"THREEEPIO";"Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We will be destroyed for sure. This is crazy!"
"THREEEPIO";"We are doomed!"
"THREEEPIO";"There will be no escape for the princess this time."
"THREE";"What is it?"
"THREEEPIO";"I should know better than to trust the logic of a medium-sized thermocapsular housing removal wizard..."
"LUKE";"Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Speed ​​up!"
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?"
"THREEEPIO";"Finally! Where have you been?"
"THREEEPIO";"They're heading this way. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines or crushed who knows what!"
"THREE";"Wait a minute, where are you going?"
"IMPERIAL OFFICER";"Death Star plans are not on the main computer."
"VADER";"Where are the transmissions you intercepted?"
"REBEL OFFICER";"We haven't intercepted any transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. We were on a diplomatic mission."
"VADER";"If this is a consular ship... where is the ambassador?"
"VADER";"Commander, destroy this ship until you find these plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want him alive!"
"TROOPER";"There she is! Ready to stun!"
"TROOPER";"She'll be fine. Inform Lord Vader that we have a prisoner."
"THREEEPIO";"Hey, you are not allowed to enter there. It is restricted. You will be disabled for sure.."
"THREE"; "Don't call me a stupid philosopher, you fat fat fat! Now get out before anyone sees you."
"THREEEPIO";"Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not going in there!"
"THREEEPIO";"I'm going to regret this."
"CHIEF PILOT";"There goes another one."
"Captain";"Keep your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited."
"THREEEPIO";"That's funny, the damage doesn't look too bad from here."
"THREEEPIO";"Are you sure these things are safe?"
"Woman";"I told you to slow down!"
"FIXER";"Did I hear a youthful noise explode around here?"
"CAMIE";"It was just Wormie in another attack."
"LUKE";"Shape you!... Biggs?"
"LUKE";"I didn't know you were back! When did you come in?"
"BIGGS";"Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hotshot. I thought you'd be here... I certainly didn't expect you to be working."
"LUKE";"The Academy hasn't changed you much...but you came back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?"
"BIGGS";"Of course I understand. I signed aboard the Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... I just got back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons."
"LUKE";"Almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!"
"DEAK";"Not again! Forget it."
"LUKE";"There they are!"
"BIGGS";"This isn't a battle, sniper... they're just sitting there! Probably a refueling tanker."
"LUKE";"But there were many shots before..."
"LUKE";"Hey, take it easy..."
"CAMIE";"Don't worry about it, Wormie."
"FIXER";"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt the Empire would fight to maintain this system. Believe me Luke, this planet is a big chunk of nothing..."
"READ";"Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate won't stand still for this, when they hear you attacked a diplomat..."
"VADER";"Don't play with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy missions this time. You went directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were sent to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you."
"READ";"I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission in Alderaan..."
"VADER";"You are part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor. Take her away!"
"COMMANDER";"Holding her is dangerous. If word gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the Senate."
"VADER";"I tracked the rebel spies to her. Now she's my only link to find their secret base!"
"COMMANDER";"you anything."
"VADER";"Leave it to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the Senate that everyone on board has been killed!"
"SECOND OFFICER";"Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was dropped during the fight, but no life forms were on board."
"VADER";"She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment to retrieve them. Take care of it yourself, Commander. There will be no one to stop us this time."
"COMMANDER";"Yes, sir."
"THREEEPIO";"How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. It feels like we're made to suffer. It's our destiny in life."
"THREEEPIO";"I have to rest before I collapse. My joints are almost frozen."
"THREEEPIO";"What a desolate place this is."
"THREEEPIO";"Where are you going?"
"THREEEPIO";"Well, I'm not going that way. It's too rocky. That's a lot easier."
"THREEEPIO";"What makes you think there are settlements there?"
"THREEEPIO";"Don't be technical with me."
"THREEEPIO";"What mission? What are you talking about? I've had enough of you! Go that way! You'll be out of order in a day, you myopic scrap pile!"
"THREEEPIO";"And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't."
"THREEEPIO";"No more adventures. I'm not going there."
"THREEEPIO";"That flawed idiot. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he won't do any better."
"THREEEPIO";"Wait, what is this? A transport! I'm saved!"
"THREEEPIO";"Here! Help! Please help!"
"LUKE";"...so I cut my power, turned off the afterburners, and got on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. Skyhopper too bad. Uncle Owen was very upset. grounded for the rest of the season. You should have been there... it was fantastic."
"BIGGS";"You should be a little more calm Luke. You may be the hottest pilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, wammo, you'll be nothing more than than a dark spot on the underside of a canyon wall."
"LUKE";"Look who's talking. Now that you've been around these giant ships, you're starting to look like my uncle. You've gone soft in the city..."
"BIGGS";"Missed you boy."
"LUKE";"Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's been so... quiet."
"BIGGS";"Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye... I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want someone to know. "
"LUKE";"What are you talking about?"
"BIGGS";"I made some friends at the Academy... when our frigate goes to one of the core systems, we'll jump ship and join the Alliance..."
"LUKE";"Join the Rebellion?! You're kidding! How?"
"BIGGS";"Calm down! You have a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!"
"LUKE";"Sorry. I'm quiet. Listen to how quiet I am. You can barely hear me..."
"BIGGS";"My friend has a friend at Bestine who can help us make contact."
"LUKE";"always trying to find them."
"BIGGS";"I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them, I'll do what I can alone... It's what we always talk about. Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to put me in service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in."
"LUKE";"And I'm stuck here..."
"BIGGS";"Thought you were going to the Academy next semester. You'll have a chance to get off this rock."
"LUKE";"Not likely! I had to unsubscribe. There's been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they even invaded the outskirts of Anchorhead."
"BIGGS";"Your uncle could stop an entire colony of Sand Peoples with one blaster."
"LUKE";"I know, but he's got enough vaporizers to make the place worth it. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now."
"BIGGS";"I'm sorry for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what's really important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?... You know they do. are beginning to nationalize trade in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is just a tenant, enslaving for the greater glory of the Empire."
"LUKE";"It couldn't happen here. You said so yourself. The Empire won't bother with that stone."
"BIGGS";"Things always change."
"LUKE";"I'd like to go... Are you going to be here long?"
"BIGGS";"No, I'm leaving in the morning..."
"LUKE";"Then I guess I won't see you."
"BIGGS";"Maybe one day... I'll keep an eye out."
"LUKE";"Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet for sure... Take care, you'll always be the best friend I have. "
"BIGGS";"Goodbye, Luke."
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!"
"FIRST TROOPER";"Someone was in the pod. The contrails are heading this way."
"SECOND SOLDIER";"Look, sir - droids."
"THREEEPIO";"Wake up! Wake up!"
"THREEEPIO";"We are doomed."
"THREEEPIO";"Do you think they will melt us?"
"THREEEPIO";"Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this ever end?"
"BERU"; "Luke, tell Owen if he gets a translator to make sure he speaks bocce."
"LUKE";"Looks like we don't have much of a choice, but I'll remind you."
"OWEN";"I don't need a protocol droid."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir - not in an environment like this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary roles that..."
"OWEN";"What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages ​​of moisture vaporizers."
"THREEEPIO";"Steamers! Sir - My first job was forGram binary load elevators... very similar to their vaporizers. You could say..."
"OWEN";"Do you speak bocce?"
"THREEEPIO";"Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm so fluent in bocce..."
"OWEN";"Alright; shut up! I'll keep this one."
"THREEEPIO";"Shut up, sir."
"OWEN";"Luke, take these two to the garage, will you? I want you to clean them both before dinner."
"LUKE";"But I was going into Toshi Station to get some power converters..."
"OWEN";"You can waste time with your friends when your tasks are done. Now, come on, let's get to work!"
"LUKE";"Alright, let's go! And red, let's go. Well, let's go, Red, let's go."
"LUKE";"Uncle Owen..."
"OWEN";"Yes?"
"LUKE";"This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!"
"OWEN";"Hey, what are you trying to push on us?"
"THREEEPIO";"Excuse me sir, but this R2 unit is in excellent condition. A real bargain."
"LUKE";"Uncle Owen..."
"OWEN";"Yes?"
"LUKE";"And that one?"
"OWEN";"What about that blue one? Let's take that one."
"LUKE";"Yes, take that off."
"THREEEPIO";"Uh, I'm sure you'll be very pleased with that, sir. He really is in first class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes."
"LUKE";"Okay, let's go."
"THREEEPIO";"Now, don't forget that! Why should I risk my neck for you is way beyond my ability!"
"THREEEPIO";"Thanks to the manufacturer! This oil bath is going to be so good. I have such a bad case of dust contamination I can barely move!"
"LUKE";"It's not fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never leaving here!"
"THREEEPIO";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"LUKE";"Well, unless you can change the weather, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!"
"THREEEPIO";"I don't think so, sir. I'm just a droid and I don't know much about these things. Not on this planet, anyway. In fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on."
"LUKE";"Well, if there's a bright center in the universe, you're on the farthest planet."
"THREEEPIO";"I see, sir."
"LUKE";"Uh, you can call me Luke."
"THREEEPIO";"I see, Mr. Luke."
"LUKE";"Just Luke."
"THREEEPIO";"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo."
"LUKE";"Hello."
"LUKE";"You've got a lot of carbon scores here. Looks like you guys saw a lot of action."
"THREEEPIO";"With all we've been through, I'm sometimes surprised we're on as good a condition as we are, with the Rebellion and all."
"LUKE";"Do you know about the Rebellion against the Empire?"
"THREEEPIO"; "That's how we came to your service, if you know what I mean, sir."
"LUKE";"Have you been in many battles?"
"THREEEPIO";"Several, I think. Not much to tell really. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and I'm not very good at telling stories. Well, not making them interesting, anyway. ."
"LUKE";"Well, my little friend, you have something very good here. Were you on a star cruiser or..."
"READ";"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You are my only hope."
"LUKE";"What is this?"
"THREEEPIO";"What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is this?"
"READ";"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You are my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You are my only hope."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Just a malfunction. Old data. Don't mind it."
"LUKE";"Who is she? She's beautiful."
"THREEEPIO";"I guess I'm not sure, sir."
"READ";"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi..."
"THREEEPIO";"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir - I believe. Our captain was connected with..."
"LUKE";"Is there anything else on this recording?"
"THREEEPIO";"Behave yourself, Artoo. You'll get us in trouble. It's okay, you can trust him. He's our new master."
"THREEEPIO";"He says it's owned by Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident around here. And it's a private message for him. Frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a little eccentric."
"LUKE";"Obi-Wan Kenobi? Does he mean old Ben Kenobi?"
"THREEEPIO";"Sorry sir, but do you know what he's talking about?"
"LUKE";"Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a weird old hermit."
"LUKE";"I wonder who she is. Looks like she's in trouble. I better reproduce the whole thing."
"THREEEPIO";"He says that the restriction screw caused a short circuit in his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the screw he can play the entire recording."
"LUKE";"Hm? Oh yeah, well I think you're too small to run away from me if I take this off! Okay."
"LUKE";"There it is."
"LUKE";"Well, wait a minute. Where did she go? Bring her back! Play the entire message."
"THREEEPIO";"eI'm playing. What are you carrying inside your rusty guts!"
"AUNT BERU";"Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!"
"LUKE";"Alright, I'll be there, Aunt Beru."
"THREEEPIO";"I'm sorry sir, but he seems to have picked up a slight vibration."
"LUKE";"Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back."
"THREEEPIO";"Just reconsider throwing this message at him."
"THREEEPIO";"No, I don't think he likes you at all."
"THREEEPIO";"No, I don't like you either."
"LUKE";"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen."
"OWEN";"What makes you think that?"
"LUKE";"Well, I found a recording while I was cleaning it. It says it belongs to someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi."
"LUKE";"I thought he might be referring to Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben."
"OWEN";"That old man is just a crazy mage. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory clean. That will be the end of it. It belongs to us now."
"LUKE";"But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for you?"
"OWEN";"He won't, I don't think he exists anymore. He died around the same time as his father."
"LUKE";"Did he know my father?"
"OWEN";"I told you to forget it. Your only concern is getting the new droids ready for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south summit working on these condensers."
"LUKE";"Yes sir. I think these new droids will work fine. Actually, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement on my staying in another season. And if these new droids work out, I want to pass on my application. to the Academy this year."
"OWEN";"You mean the next semester before harvest?"
"LUKE";"Of course, there are more than enough droids."
"OWEN";"Harvest is when I need you most. Just one more season. This year we'll do enough at harvest so I can hire a few more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. "
"OWEN";"You must understand that I need you here, Luke."
"LUKE";"But it's a whole year."
"OWEN";"Look, it's just one more season."
"LUKE";"Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left."
"AUNT BERU";"Where are you going?"
"LUKE";"Looks like I'm not going anywhere. I have to finish cleaning these droids."
"AUNT BERU"; "Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends are gone. It means a lot to him."
"OWEN";"I'll make it up to him next year. I promise."
"AUNT BERU";"Luke is not a farmer, Owen. He has a lot of his father in him."
"OWEN";"That's what I'm afraid of."
"LUKE";"What are you doing hiding there?"
"THREEEPIO";"It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't disable me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, faulty; he kept babbling about his mission."
"LUKE";"Oh no!"
"THREEEPIO";"That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astrodroids are getting out of control. Even I can't understand their logic sometimes."
"LUKE";"How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere to be seen. Damn!"
"THREEEPIO";"Forgive me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?"
"LUKE";"It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around. We'll have to wait until morning."
"OWEN";"Luke, I'm going to turn off the power tonight."
"LUKE";"Alright, I'll be there in a few minutes. Dude, I'll get it."
"LUKE";"You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, he excels at it, sir."
"OWEN";"Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be hanging around right now!"
"OWEN";"Did you see Luke this morning?"
"AUNT BERU";"He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early."
"OWEN";"Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?"
"AUNT BERU";"I think so."
"OWEN";"Well, he better have those units in the south lane fixed by noon or it'll be hell to pay!"
"LUKE";"What do you mean."
"LUKE";"Old Ben Kenobi lives this way somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have gotten this far. We must have lost him. Uncle Owen won't take it very well. ."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, it would help if you told him it was my fault."
"LUKE";"Of course. He needs you. He'd probably just disable you for a day or two..."
"THREEEPIO";"Disable! Well, on the other hand, if you hadn't removed the retaining screw from it..."
"LUKE";"Wait, there's something dead ahead in the scanner. Looks like our droid... has stepped on the accelerator."
"LUKE";"Hey, wow, where do you think you're going?"
"THREEEPIO";"Master Luke here is its rightful owner. Let's not have this Obi-Wan Kenobi nonsense anymore... and don't talk to me about your mission either. You're lucky he doesn't blow you up in a million pieces right here."
"LUKE";"Well, come on. It's getting late. I just hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up."
"THREEEPIO";"If you don't mind my saying, sir, I think I should disable the little fugitive until I get him back. Go to your office."
"LUKE";"No, he won't try anything."
"LUKE";"What's wrong with him now?"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast."
"LUKE";"Sand Person! Or worse! Come on, let's have a look. Let's go."
"LUKE";"There are two Banthas down there, but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandfolk. I can see one of them now."
"BEN";"Hello! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid."
"BEN";"Don't worry, he'll be fine."
"LUKE";"What happened?"
"BEN";"Rest son, you've had a busy day. You're lucky you're still in one piece."
"LUKE";"Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!"
"BEN"; "The Jundland Wastes are not to be traversed lightly. Tell me, young Luke, what brings you here?"
"LUKE";"Ah, this little droid! I think he's looking for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of one. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?"
"BEN";"Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? That's a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time."
"LUKE";"I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead."
"BEN";"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet."
"LUKE";"You know him!"
"BEN";"Well, of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't used the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born."
"LUKE";"So the droid belongs to you."
"BEN";"I don't remember having a droid. Very interesting..."
"BEN";"I think we'd better get inside. The Sand People are easily scared, but they'll be back soon and in greater numbers."
"LUKE";"... Threepio!"
"THREEEPIO";"Where am I? I must have taken a bad step..."
"LUKE";"Can you stand? We have to get out of here before the Sand People return."
"THREEEPIO";"I don't think I'll make it. Go on, Master Luke. There's no point in taking any chances for my sake. I'm finished."
"LUKE";"No, you're not. What kind of conversation is this?"
"BEN";"Quick son...they're on the move."
"LUKE";"No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter."
"BEN";"That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold on to your father's ideals. I thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved."
"LUKE";"Did you fight in the Clone Wars?"
"BEN";"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight just like your father."
"LUKE";"I wish I had met him."
"BEN";"He was the best star pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand that you also became a good pilot. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me..."
"BEN";"I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have it when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn idiot. Idealistic crusade like yours." father did."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, if you won't need me, I'll close for a while."
"LUKE";"Sure, go ahead."
"LUKE";"What is it?"
"BEN";"Your father's lightsaber. This is a Jedi Knight's weapon. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster."
"BEN";"An elegant weapon for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire."
"LUKE";"How did my father die?"
"BEN";"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was my pupil until he became evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered his father. Now the Jedi are anything but extinct. Vader was seduced. by the dark side of the Force."
"LUKE";"The Force?"
"BEN";"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi their power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It unites the galaxy."
"BEN";"Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from."
"LUKE";"I saw part of the message that he was..."
"BEN";"Looks like I found it."
"READ";"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his fight against the Empire. I regret not being able to present my father's request to you personally, but my ship has fallen under attack and I fear my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into this R2 unit's memory systems. My father will know how to recover You must deliver this droid safely to him in Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you are my only hope."
"BEN";"You must learn the ways of the Force if you want to come with me to Alderaan."
"LUKE";"Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I have to go home. It's late, I'm ready for it."
"BEN";"I need your help, Luke. I'm getting too old for this kind of thing. She needs your help."
"LUKE";"I can't get involved! I have work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it. this now. It's a long way from here."
"BEN";"It's your uncle talking."
"LUKE";"Oh, God, my uncle. How am I going to explain this?"
"BEN";"Learn about the Force, Luke."
"LUKE";"Look, I can take you to Anchorhead. You can take a shuttle there to Mos Eisley or wherever you go."
"BEN";"You must do what you think is right, of course."
"TAGGE";"Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is very well equipped. They are more dangerous than you might think."
"MOTTI";"Dangerous to your Starfleet, Commander; not for this battle station!"
"TAGGE";"The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as..."
"TARKIN";"The Imperial Senate will no longer be a concern for us. I have just received news that the Emperor has permanently dissolved the council. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away."
"TAGGE";"That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without bureaucracy?"
"TARKIN";"Regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep local systems in line. Fear of this battle station."
"TAGGE";"What about the Rebellion? If the Rebels have gotten a full technical read on this station, it's possible, though unlikely, that they'll find a weakness and exploit it."
"VADER";"The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands."
"MOTTI";"Any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they have obtained. This station is now the supreme power of the universe. I suggest we use it!"
"VADER";"Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've built. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force."
"MOTTI";"Don't try to scare us with your sorcerer ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion didn't help you conjure up the stolen data tapes, nor did it give you enough clairvoyance to find the Rebel's hiding place. Strong. .."
"VADER";"I find your lack of faith disturbing."
"TARKIN";"Enough of this! Vader, let him go!"
"VADER";"As you wish."
"TARKIN";"This fight is useless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel stronghold when this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift blow."
"LUKE";"Looks like the Sand People did it, all right. Look, here are gaffes, bantha banners. It's just... I've never heard of them hitting something this big before."
"BEN";"They didn't. But we must think so. These tracks are side by side. Sand People always walk in single file to hide their numbers."
"LUKE";"These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio."
"BEN";"And those blast points, too accurate for the Sand People. Only Imperial stormtroopers are that accurate."
"LUKE";"Why do imperial troops want to kill Jawas?"
"LUKE";"If they tracked the robots here, they might have found out who they sold them to. And that would have taken them back home!"
"BEN";"Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous."
"LUKE";"Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!"
"VADER";"And now, Your Highness, let's discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base."
"BEN";"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, if you had been there. You would have been killed too, and the droids would now be in the Empire's hands."
"LUKE";"I want to go with you to Alderaan. There is nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father."
"BEN";"Mos Eisley's Spaceport. You will never find a more miserable hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious."
"TROOPER";"How long have you had these droids?"
"LUKE";"About three or four seasons."
"BEN";"They're for sale if you want them."
"SOLDIER";"Let me see your ID."
"BEN";"You don't need to see his ID."
"TROOPER";"We don't need to see his ID."
"BEN";"looking for."
"TROOPER";"These are not the droids we're looking for."
"BEN";"He can take care of his business."
"TROOPER";"You can mind your own business."
"BEN";"Go ahead."
"TROOPER";"Go on. Go on."
"THREEEPIO";"I can't stand these Jawas. Disgusting creatures."
"LUKE";"Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got past those soldiers. I thought we were dead."
"BEN";"The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally."
"LUKE";"Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here who will take us to Alderaan?"
"BEN";"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Just be careful. This place can be a little rough."
"LUKE";"I'm ready for anything."
"THREEEPIO";"Come on, Artoo."
"BARTENDER";"We don't serve their kind here!"
"LUKE";"What?"
"BARTENDER";"Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here."
"LUKE";"Listen, why don't you wait by the speeder. We don't want any trouble."
"THREEEPIO";"I fully agree with the Lord."
"CREATURE";"Negola dewaghi lumberjack?!?"
"HUMAN";"He doesn't like you."
"LUKE";"I'm sorry."
"HUMAN";"I don't like you either"
"HUMAN";"Don't insult us. Just watch yourself. We are wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems."
"LUKE";"I'll take care of what."
"HUMAN";"You will be dead."
"BEN";"This little one is not worth the effort. Come, let me buy you something..."
"BARTENDER";"No detonators! No detonators!"
"BEN";"This is Chewbacca. He is immediate on a ship that can meet our needs."
"THREEEPIO";"I don't like the look of this."
"HAN";"Han Solo. I'm the captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for a ticket to the Alderaan system."
"BEN";"Yes indeed. If it's a fast ship."
"HAN";"Fast ship? Have you never heard of the Millennium Falcon?"
"BEN";"Should have?"
"HAN";"It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!"
"HAN";"I outrun the Imperial ships, not the local cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the payload?"
"BEN";"Passengers only. Me, the boy, two droids, and no questions."
"HAN";"What is it? Some kind of local problem?"
"BEN";"Let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial involvement."
"HAN";"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? And it'll cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance."
"LUKE";"Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!"
"HAN";"But who will pilot, boy! You?"
"LUKE";"You bet I could. I'm not that bad of a pilot! We don't have to sit here and listen..."
"BEN";"We don't have much with us. But we can pay you two thousand now, fifteen more when we get to Alderaan."
"HAN";"Seventeen, huh!"
"HAN";"Okay. You've got a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Dock 94."
"BEN";"Ninety-four."
"HAN";"Looks like someone is starting to take an interest in your work."
"TROOPER";"Alright, let's check."
"HAN";"Seventeen thousand! These guys must be really desperate. This might really save my neck. Go back to the ship and prepare it."
"BEN";"You'll have to sell your speeder."
"LUKE";"It's okay. I'm never going back to this planet again."
"GREEDO";"Going somewhere, Solo?"
"HAN";"Yes, Greedo. I was actually going to see your boss. Tell Jabba I have his money."
"GREEDO";"It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba put a price on your head, so big that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I found you first."
"HAN";"Yes, but this time I got the money."
"GREEDO";"If you give it to me, I might forget I ever found you."
"HAN";"I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba..."
"GREEDO";"Jabba's finished with you. He doesn't have time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser."
"HAN";"Even I get approached sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?"
"GREEDO";"You can say that to Jabba. He can only take his ship."
"HAN";"Over my dead body."
"GREEDO";"That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time."
"HAN";"Yes, I bet so."
"HAN";"Sorry for the mess."
"VADER";"Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her."
"IMPERIAL OFFICER";"Final checkout is complete. All systems are operational. Which direction should we set?"
"TARKIN";"Maybe she responded to an alternate form of persuasion."
"VADER";"What do you mean?"
"TARKIN";"I think it's time we demonstrated the full power of this station. Set its course for Princess Leia's home planet, Alderaan."
"TROOPER";"With pleasure."
"THREEEPIO";"Lock the door, Artoo."
"TROOPER";"Alright, check this side of the street. It's safe. Go to the next door."
"THREEEPIO";"I'd rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault."
"THREEEPIO";"Watch your language!"
"LUKE"; "He says it's the best he can do. Ever since the XP-38 came out, they"
"BEN";"It will be enough."
"BEN";"If the ship is as fast as it is boasting, we should do fine."
"JABBA";"Come on, Solo!"
"HAN";"I've been waiting for you, Jabba."
"JABBA";"I hoped you would."
"HAN";"I'm not the type to run."
"JABBA"; "Han, my boy, there are times when you let me down...why didn't you pay me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that...after all we've been through together."
"HAN";"You sent Greedo to blow me up."
"JABBA"; "Han, because you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was just conveying my concern about your delays. He wouldn't blow you up."
"HAN";"I think he thought so. Next time don't send one of those idiots. If you have something to say to me, come to see me yourself."
"JABBA";"Han, Han! If only you didn't have to dump that shipment of spices... you understand that I can't make an exception. Your shipment at the first sign of an Imperial ship? Not a good deal."
"HAN";"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I didn't have a choice, but I have a letter now and I can pay you back, plus some more. I just need some more time."
"JABBA";"Put your blasters away. Han my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you. So for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but that's it, if you let me down again, I'll put such a high price on your head that you won't be able to approach a civilized system for the rest of your short life."
"HAN";"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's a pleasure."
"LUKE";"What rubbish."
"HAN";"She's going to do point five beyond the speed of light. She might not look like much, but she's where it matters, boy. I've added some special modifications myself."
"HAN";"We're in a bit of a hurry, so if you hurry aboard, we'll get out of here."
"THREEEPIO";"Hello, sir."
"SOLDIER";"Which way?"
"SOLDIER";"All right, men. Load your weapons!"
"SOLDIER";"Stop that ship!"
"SOLDIER";"Finish them!"
"HAN";"Chewie, get us out of here!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel."
"HAN";"It looks like an imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try to hold them. Tilt the deflector shield while I do the calculations for the jump to light speed."
"HAN";"Stay tuned! There are two more coming; they will try to cut us."
"LUKE";"Why don't you get over them? I thought you said this thing was fast."
"HAN";"Watch your mouth, kid, or you'll find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough when we make the jump into hyperspace. Besides, I know a few tricks. We'll miss them!"
"HAN";"This is where the fun begins!"
"BEN";"How long before you can make the leap to light speed?"
"HAN";"It will take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navigation computer."
"LUKE";"Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining..."
"HAN";"Traveling through hyperspace isn't like clearing crops, kid! Without accurate calculations, we could fly straight through a star or jump too close to a supernova and that would end your trip pretty quickly, wouldn't it? ?"
"LUKE";"What's that blinking?"
"HAN";"We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'll jump to the speed of light."
"MOTTI";"We have entered the Alderaan system."
"READ";"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your stench when I was brought aboard."
"TARKIN";"Charming to the end. You don't know how hard I found it to sign the order to end your life!"
"READ";"TAKE RESPONSIBILITY YOURSELF!"
"TARKIN";"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest in a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now."
"READ";"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
"TARKIN";"Not after we demonstrated the power of this station. In a way, you determined the choice of planet that will be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to give us the location of the Rebel base, I chose to test the destructive power of this one. season... on your home planet of Alderaan."
"READ";"No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't..."
"TARKIN";"Would you prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!"
"TARKIN";"I'm tired of asking this. So it will be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?"
"READ";"Dantooine."
"READ";"They are in Dantooine."
"TARKIN";"Over there. You see Lord Vader, she might be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You can shoot when you're ready."
"READ";"What?"
"TARKIN";"You're trusting too much. Dantooine is too far away to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We'll deal with your rebellious friends soon."
"READ";"No!"
"VADER";"Start primary ignition."
"LUKE";"Are you okay? What's wrong?"
"BEN";"I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly screamed in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened."
"BEN";"You'd better get on with your exercises."
"HAN";"Well, you can forget about your problems with those imperial slugs. I told you I'd get over them."
"HAN";"Not everyone thanks me at once."
"HAN";"Anyway, we should be in Alderaan about oh-two hundred hours."
"THREEEPIO";"Now be careful, Artoo."
"THREEEPIO";"He made a fair play. Yelling about it won't help you."
"HAN";"Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee."
"THREEEPIO";"But sir, no one bothers to disturb a droid."
"HAN";"That's because droids don't take people's arms off when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that."
"THREEEPIO";"I see, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win."
"BEN";"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him."
"LUKE";"You mean you control your actions?"
"BEN";"Partially. But it also obeys your commands."
"HAN";"Hypocritical religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster by your side, boy."
"LUKE";"You don't believe in the Force, do you?"
"HAN";"Boy, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange things, but I've never seen anything that makes me believe that there is an all-powerful force controlling everything. There is no energy field. mystic that controls my destiny."
"HAN";"It's all a bunch of simple, pointless tricks."
"BEN";"I suggest you try again, Luke."
"BEN";"This time, let go of your conscious self and act on instinct."
"LUKE";"With the explosion shield down, I can't even see. How am I going to fight?"
"BEN";"Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them."
"BEN";"Stand out with your feelings."
"BEN";"You see, you can do this."
"HAN";"I call it luck."
"BEN";"In my experience, luck doesn't exist."
"HAN";"Look, doing well against remote controls is one thing. Doing well against the living? That's another thing."
"HAN";"Looks like we're coming to Alderaan."
"LUKE";"You know, I felt something. I could almost see the remote."
"BEN";"That's good. You've taken your first step into a bigger world."
"TARKIN";"Yes."
"CASS OFFICER";"Our reconnaissance ships have arrived at Dantooine. They have found the remains of a rebel base, but estimate it to have been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems."
"TARKIN";"She lied! She lied to us!"
"VADER";"I told you she would never knowingly betray the Rebellion."
"TARKIN";"Finish her... immediately!"
"HAN";"Wait, Chewie, here we go. Turn off the sublight engines."
"HAN";"What...? Ah, we went out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some sort of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts."
"LUKE";"What's going on?"
"HAN";"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!"
"LUKE";"What do you mean? Where is it?"
"HAN";"That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It's not there. It was totally blown up."
"LUKE";"What? How?"
"BEN";"Destroyed... by the Empire!"
"HAN";"The entire Starfleet could not destroy the entire planet. It would take a thousand ships with more firepower than I..."
"HAN";"There's another ship coming."
"LUKE";"Maybe they know what happened."
"BEN";"It's an Imperial fighter."
"LUKE";"He followed us!"
"BEN";"No. It's a short-range fighter."
"HAN";"There is no base around here. Where did it come from?"
"LUKE";"Surely he's leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in trouble."
"HAN";"Not if I can help it. Chewie... block your transmissions."
"BEN";"You'd better let him go. It's too out of reach."
"HAN";"Not for long..."
"BEN";"A fighter this size couldn't go that deep into space alone."
"LUKE";"So he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something..."
"HAN";"Well, he won't be around long enough to tell anyone about us."
"LUKE";"Look at him. He's going to that little moon."
"HAN";"I think I can catch him before he gets there... he's almost in range."
"BEN";"That's not the moon! It's a space station."
"HAN";"It's too big to be a space station."
"LUKE";"I have a bad feeling about this."
"BEN";"Turn the ship over!"
"HAN";"Yes, I think you're right. Reverse complete! Chewie, block auxiliary energy."
"LUKE";"Why are we still moving towards this?"
"HAN";"We're trapped in a tractor beam! It's pulling us!"
"LUKE";"But there has to be something you can do!"
"HAN";"There's nothing I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'll have to hang up. But they won't catch me without a fight!"
"BEN";"You can't win. But there are alternatives to fight."
"VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM";"Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic field."
"OFFICIAL";"To your stations!"
"OFFICIAL";"Come with me."
"OFFICIAL";"Close all external protections! Close all external protections!"
"TARKIN";"Yes."
"VOICE";"We captured a freighter entering the ruins of the Alderaan system. Its marks match those of a ship that left Mos Eisley."
"VADER";"They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She might still be of some use to us."
"VOICE";"Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release the charges."
"OFFICIAL";"There is no one on board, sir. According to the diary, the crew abandoned the ship shortly after takeoff. Must be a decoy, sir. Several escape pods were dropped."
"VADER";"Found some droid?"
"OFFICIAL";"No, sir. If there were any on board, they must have abandoned them too."
"VADER";"Send a scan team aboard. I want every part of this ship checked."
"OFFICIAL";"Yes, sir."
"VADER";"I feel something... a presence I haven't felt since..."
"OFFICIAL";"Bring me a double scan team here. I want every part of this ship checked!"
"LUKE";"Boy, how lucky you are to have these compartments."
"HAN";"I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. That's ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam."
"BEN";"Leave it to me!"
"HAN";"Damn idiot. I knew you were going to say that!"
"BEN";"Who is the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?"
"TROOPER";"The ship is all yours. If the scanners detect anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go."
"HAN";"Hey, could you give us a hand with this?"
"GANTRY OFFICER";"TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy?"
"GANTRY OFFICER";"Take over. We have a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do."
"LUKE";"You know, between his howl and you blasting everything in sight, it's any wonder the entire station doesn't know we're here."
"HAN";"Bring us in! I prefer a straight fight to all this mess."
"THREEEPIO";"We found the computer socket, sir."
"BEN";"Plug it in. It should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network."
"THREEEPIO";"He says he has found the main control of the energy beam that is holding the ship here. He will try to make the precise location appear on the monitor."
"THREEEPIO";"The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor at seven locations. A loss of power at one of the terminals will allow the ship to exit."
"BEN";"I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone."
"HAN";"Whatever you say. I've done more than I bargained for on this trip."
"LUKE";"I want to go with you."
"BEN";"Be patient, Luke. Stay and take care of the droids."
"LUKE";"But he can..."
"BEN";"They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your fate is on a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always!"
"HAN";"Dude, you said that, Chewie."
"HAN";"Where did you dig up that old fossil?"
"LUKE";"Ben is a great man."
"HAN";"Yes, great for getting us into trouble."
"LUKE";"I didn't hear you give any ideas..."
"HAN";"Well, anything would be better than waiting for them to pick us up..."
"LUKE";"Who do you think..."
"LUKE";"What is it?"
"THREEEPIO";"I don't think I'm sure, sir. It says \"
"LUKE";"Well, who... who did he find?"
"THREEEPIO";"Princess Leia."
"LUKE";"The princess? Is she here?"
"HAN";"Princess?"
"LUKE";"Where... where is she?"
"HAN";"Princess? What's going on?"
"THREEEPIO";"Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be fired."
"LUKE";"Oh no! We have to do something."
"HAN";"What are you talking about?"
"LUKE";"The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message. We have to help her."
"HAN";"Now look, don't come up with any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here."
"LUKE";"But he didn't know she was here. Look, are you going to find a way back to the detention block?"
"HAN";"I'm not going anywhere."
"LUKE";"They're going to execute you. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't just want to wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay."
"HAN";"Marching to the detention area is not what I had in mind."
"LUKE";"But they'll kill her!"
"HAN";"Better her than me..."
"LUKE";"She's rich."
"HAN";"Rich?"
"LUKE";"Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be..."
"HAN";"What?"
"LUKE";"Well, more wealth than you can imagine."
"HAN";"I don't know, I can imagine a lot!"
"LUKE";"You'll make it!"
"HAN";"I better!"
"LUKE";"You will..."
"HAN";"All right, kid. But you better be right about this!"
"LUKE";"Alright."
"HAN";"What's your plan?"
"LUKE";"Uh... Threepio, give me those binders, will you?"
"LUKE";"Okay. Now, I'll put this on you."
"LUKE";"Ok. Han, you put this on."
"HAN";"Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind."
"THREEEPIO";"Master Luke, sir! Forgive me for asking...but, ah...what are Artoo and I supposed to do if we are discovered here?"
"LUKE";"Lock the door!"
"HAN";"And I hope they don't have blasters."
"THREEEPIO";"That's not very comforting."
"LUKE";"I can't see anything in this helmet."
"HAN";"That won't work."
"LUKE";"Why didn't you say that before?"
"HAN";"I said that before!"
"OFFICIAL";"Where are you taking this...thing?"
"LUKE";"Block One-One-Three-Eight Prisoner Transfer."
"OFFICIAL";"I haven't been notified. I'll have to clean it up."
"HAN";"Watch out! He's loose!"
"LUKE";"He will tear us apart."
"HAN";"Go get him!"
"HAN";"We have to find out which cell your princess is in. Here it is... celto twenty-one and eight-seven. You will get it. I will keep them here."
"HAN";"Everything is under control. Normal situation."
"INTERCOM VOICE";"What happened?"
"HAN";"Uh... had a little weapon malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly fine now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thanks. How are you?"
"VOICE FROM INTERCOM";"We're sending a squad."
"HAN";"Uh, uh, negative, negative. We've had a reactor leak here just now. Give us a few minutes to block it. Big leak...very dangerous."
"INTERCOM VOICE";"Who is it? What is your operation number?"
"HAN";"Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We'll have company!"
"READ";"Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?"
"LUKE";"What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you."
"READ";"Who are you?"
"LUKE";"I'm here to rescue you. I have your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi."
"READ";"Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?"
"LUKE";"Let's go!"
"VADER";"He's here..."
"TARKIN";"Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think like that?"
"VADER";"A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my former master."
"TARKIN";"Surely he must be dead by now."
"VADER";"Don't underestimate the Force."
"TARKIN";"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out from the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion."
"TARKIN";"Yes."
"VOICE FROM INTERCOM"; "Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert on detention block AA-twenty-three."
"TARKIN";"The princess! Put all sections on alert!"
"VADER";"Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him."
"TARKIN";"If you're right, he can't escape."
"VADER";"Escape may not be your plan. I must face it alone."
"HAN";"Chewie!"
"HAN";"Stay behind me! Stay behind me!"
"HAN";"You can't go out like that."
"READ";"Looks like you managed to cut our only escape route."
"HAN";"Perhaps you want it back in your cell, Your Highness."
"LUKE";"See-Three! See-Three!"
"THREE";"Yes sir?"
"LUKE";"We've been cut! Are there other ways to get out of the cell?...What was that? I didn't copy it!"
"THREEEPIO";"I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. Main entrance appears to be the only exit; all other information on your level is restricted."
"SOLDIER'S VOICE";"Open there!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh no!"
"LUKE";"There is no other way out."
"HAN";"I can't hold them forever! What now?"
"READ";"This is a ransom. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan to leave?"
"HAN";"He's the brain, honey."
"LUKE";"Well, I don't..."
"HAN";"What the hell are you doing?"
"READ";"Somebody has to save our skins. To the trash, smartass."
"HAN";"Get in there you big furry idiot! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it."
"HAN";"Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm starting to like her. Get in there!"
"HAN";"Ah! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an amazing smell you discovered! Let's get out of here! Get out of there..."
"LUKE";"No! Wait!"
"LUKE";"Will you forget? I already tried. It's magnetically sealed!"
"READ";"Keep this thing! You'll kill us all."
"HAN";"Absolutely, Your Honor. Look, I had everything under control until you brought us here. You know, it won't be long before they find out what happened to us."
"READ";"Could be worse..."
"HAN";"It's worse."
"LUKE";"There's something alive here!"
"HAN";"That's your imagination."
"LUKE";"Something goes through my leg! Look! Did you see that?"
"HAN";"What?"
"LUKE";"Help!"
"HAN";"Luke! Luke! Luke!"
"READ";"Luke!"
"READ";"Luke, Luke, take this."
"LUKE";"Damn it, please! My gun is jammed."
"HAN";"Where?"
"LUKE";"Anywhere! Oh!!"
"HAN";"Luke! Luke!"
"READ";"Grab it!"
"READ";"What happened?"
"LUKE";"I don't know, he just let me go and disappeared..."
"HAN";"I have a bad feeling about this."
"LUKE";"The walls are moving!"
"READ";"Don't just stand there. Try to hold it with something."
"LUKE";"Wait a minute!"
"LUKE";"Threepio! Come on Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?"
"FIRST SOLDIER";"Take over! Take care of him! Look over there!"
"THREEEPIO";"They're crazy! They're heading to the prison level. If you hurry, you can catch them."
"FIRST OFFICER";"Follow me! You stand guard."
"THREEEPIO";"Let's go!"
"THREEEPIO";"Ah! All this excitement has invaded my colleague's circuits here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him in for maintenance."
"SOLDIER";"All right."
"LUKE";"Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!"
"HAN";"Get to the top!"
"READ";"Can't"
"LUKE";"Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, can you come in?"
"THREEEPIO";"They're not here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured."
"THREEEPIO";"Fast!"
"HAN";"One thing's for sure. We're all going to get a lot thinner! Stay on top of it!"
"READ";"I'm trying!"
"THREEEPIO";"Thank God they didn't find them! Where could they be?"
"THREEEPIO";"Use comlink? Oh my! I forgot that and hung up!"
"THREEEPIO";"Are you there, sir?"
"LUKE";"Trespios!"
"THREEEPIO";"We had some problems..."
"LUKE";"Close all garbage disposals in the detention level, yes? Do you copy?"
"LUKE";"Close all garbage disposals on the detention level."
"LUKE";"Close all garbage disposals on the detention level."
"THREEEPIO";"No. Turn them all off! Hurry!"
"THREEEPIO";"Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Damn my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!"
"LUKE";"Threepio, we're fine!"
"LUKE";"We're fine. You did very well."
"LUKE";"Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?"
"HAN";"Three-two-six-eight-two-seven."
"HAN";"If we can avoid more female advice, we should be able to get out of here."
"LUKE";"Well, let's move!"
"HAN";"Where are you going?"
"READ";"No, wait. They will listen!"
"HAN";"Come here, you big coward!"
"HAN";"Chewie! Come here!"
"READ";"Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I say. Okay?"
"HAN";"Look, Your Excellency, let's clarify something! I take orders from a person! Me!"
"READ";"It's a wonder you're still alive. Will someone get this big walking rug out of my way?"
"HAN";"No reward is worth that."
"OFFICIAL";"Protect this area until the alert is cancelled."
"FIRST SOLDIER";"Give me regular reports."
"FIRST SOLDIER";"Do you know what's going on?"
"SECOND SOLDIER";"Maybe it's another exercise."
"SECOND SOLDIER";"What was that?"
"FIRST SOLDIER";"Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it."
"HAN";"There she is."
"LUKE";"See-Threepio, do you copy?"
"THREEEPIO";"At the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar in front of the ship."
"LUKE";"We're right above you. Wait."
"READ";"Did you come on that thing? You're braver than I thought."
"HAN";"Cool! Let's go!"
"FIRST SOLDIER";"It's them! Destroy them!"
"HAN";"Go back to the ship!"
"LUKE";"Where are you going? Come back!"
"READ";"He certainly has courage."
"LUKE";"What good will it do us if he kills himself? Let's go!"
"LUKE";"I think we took the wrong path."
"READ";"There is no lock!"
"LUKE";"This should hold for a while."
"READ";"Quick, we have to cross. Find the control that extends the bridge."
"LUKE";"Oh, I think I just blew it."
"READ";"They're coming!"
"LUKE";"Here, hold this."
"READ";"Here they come!"
"READ";"For luck!"
"THREEEPIO";"Where could they be?"
"TROOPER";"Close the security doors!"
"TROOPER";"Open the protective doors! Open the protective doors!"
"VADER";"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, finally. The circle is now complete."
"VADER";"When I left you, I was only the apprentice; now I am the master."
"BEN";"Just a master of evil, Darth."
"VADER";"Your powers are weak, old man."
"BEN";"You can't win, Darth. If you take me down, I'll become more powerful than you can imagine."
"HAN";"Didn't we just leave this party?"
"HAN";"What held you back?"
"READ";"Meet some old friends."
"LUKE";"Is the ship okay?"
"HAN";"Sounds good if we can do it. I just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of service."
"LUKE";"Look!"
"THREEEPIO";"Come on, Artoo, we're going!"
"HAN";"Now is our chance! Go!"
"LUKE";"No!"
"HAN";"Let's go!"
"READ";"Come on! Luke, it's too late!"
"HAN";"Fix the door! Boy!"
"BEN";"Run, Luke! Run!"
"HAN";"Hope the old man got that tractor beam out if it's working, or this will be a very short trip. Okay, get it right!"
"HAN";"We're approaching the sentry ships. Hold them! Tilt the deflector shields while I load the main guns!"
"LUKE";"I can't believe he's gone."
"READ";"There was nothing you could have done."
"HAN";"Come on buddy, we're not out of this yet!"
"HAN";"Are you in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!"
"READ";"Here they come!"
"LUKE";"They're coming too fast!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oooh!"
"READ";"We lost the side controls."
"HAN";"Don't worry, she'll handle it."
"HAN";"Did you hear me, baby? Hold on!"
"LUKE";"Got him! Got him!"
"HAN";"Great boy! Don't be arrogant."
"READ";"There are still two more out there!"
"LUKE";"That's it! We did it!"
"READ";"We did it!"
"THREEEPIO";"Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault."
"TARKIN";"Are they out?"
"VADER";"They just jumped into hyperspace."
"TARKIN";"Are you sure the tracer beacon is safe aboard their ship? I'm taking a terrible risk, Vader. This better work."
"HAN";"Not bad rescue, huh? You know, sometimes I even surprise myself."
"READ";"That doesn't seem too difficult. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape."
"HAN";"Easy...you call that easy?"
"READ";"They're tracking us!"
"HAN";"Not this ship, sister."
"READ";"At least the information in Artoo is still intact."
"HAN";"What is so important? What is he carrying?"
"READ";"The technical readings from that battle station. I just hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet!"
"HAN";"It's for me, sister! Look, I'm not in it for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, princess. I hope to get paid well. I'm in it. for the money!"
"READ";"You don't have to worry about your reward. If money is all you love, then this is what you'll get!"
"READ";"Your friend is a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about something...or someone."
"LUKE";"I care!"
"LUKE";"So... what do you think of her, Han?"
"HAN";"I'm trying not to, kid!"
"LUKE";"Well..."
"HAN";"Still, she has a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me..."
"LUKE";"No!"
"WILLARD";"You are safe! We had feared the worst."
"WILLARD";"When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father."
"READ";"We have no time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has certainly located us here. It is the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use this R2 unit's information to plan the attack. It is our only hope."
"TARKIN";"Yes."
"DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE";"We are approaching the planet Yavin. The rebel base is on a moon on the other side. We are preparing to orbit the planet."
"DODONNA";"The battle station is heavily armored and carries firepower greater than half the Starfleet. Its defenses are designed around a full-scale direct attack. A small one-man fighter should be capable of to penetrate the external defense."
"GOLDEN LEADER";"Forgive me for asking, sir, but what good are snobbish fighters against this?"
"DODONNA";"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be a threat, or they would have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia demonstrated a weakness in the battle station."
"DODONNA";"The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight through this trench and slide the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It is a small thermal exhaust port, just below the main port. The well leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction that should destroy the station."
"DODONNA";"Just a precise hit will set off a chain reaction. The shaft is shielded against lightning, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes."
"WEDGE";"This is impossible even for a computer."
"LUKE";"It's not impossible. I used to hunt mice in my T-16 at home. They're not much bigger than two meters."
"DODONNA";"Equip your ships! And may the Force be with you!"
"DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE";"Orbiting the planet at full speed. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes."
"VADER";"This will be a day long remembered. He saw the end of Kenobi and he will soon see the end of the Rebellion."
"MAN";"All flight troops, equip your stations. All flight troops, equip your stations."
"LUKE";"So...you got your reward and you're leaving?"
"HAN";"That's right, yes! I have some old debts I have to pay off with these things. Even if I didn't, don't you think I'd be foolish enough to stick around, do you? with us? You're too good at a fight. I could use you."
"LUKE";"Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them."
"HAN";"What's a bounty worth if you're not around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station isn't my idea of ​​courage. It's more like suicide."
"LUKE";"Alright. Well, take care, Han... I think that's what you're best at, isn't it?"
"HAN";"Hey Luke...may the Force be with you!"
"HAN";"What are you looking at? I know what I'm doing."
"READ";"What's wrong?"
"LUKE";"Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind."
"READ";"He has to go his own way. No one can choose for him."
"LUKE";"I just wish Ben were here."
"BIGGS";"Luke! I can't believe it! How did you get here... are you going to hang out with us?!"
"LUKE";"Biggs! Of course, I'll be there with you! Listen, I have some stories to tell..."
"RED LEADER";"Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked on the Incom T-65?"
"BIGGS";"Sir, Luke is the best pilot in the Outer Rim territories."
"RED LEADER";"I met your father once when I was just a boy. He was a great pilot. You'll do fine. If you have half your father's skill, you'll do better than fine."
"LUKE";"Thanks sir. I'll try."
"BIGGS";"I have to board. Listen, you'll tell me your stories when you get back rmos. It's all right?"
"LUKE";"I told you I'd make it one day, Biggs."
"BIGGS";"You did, alright. It'll be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that will never be stopped!"
"CHIEF";"This R2 unit of yours looks a little worn out. Want a new one?"
"LUKE";"Not in your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. Are you okay, Artoo?"
"CHIEF";"Okay, she'll take it easy!"
"THREEEPIO";"Hold on, Artoo, you have to go back."
"THREEEPIO";"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?"
"BEN";"Luke, the Force will be with you."
"MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE";"Ready alert. Death Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes."
"RED LEADER";"All wards report."
"RED TEN";"Red Ten waiting."
"RED SEVEN";"Red Seven waiting."
"BIGGS";"Three Reds waiting."
"PORKINS";"Red Six waiting."
"RED NINE";"Red Nine waiting."
"WEDGE";"Red Two waiting."
"RED ELEVEN";"Red Eleven waiting."
"LUKE";"Five Red waiting."
"RED LEADER";"Lock S-foils in attack position."
"RED LEADER";"We're passing through their magnetic field."
"RED LEADER";"Hold tight!"
"RED LEADER";"Turn on your deflectors."
"RED LEADER";"Double front!"
"WEDGE";"Look at the size of this thing!"
"RED LEADER";"Cut the conversation, Red Two."
"RED LEADER";"Accelerate to attack speed. That's it, guys!"
"GOLD LEADER";"Red Leader, this is the Gold Leader."
"RED LEADER";"I copy, Gold Leader."
"GOLD LEADER";"We are now starting for the target well."
"RED LEADER";"We are in position. I will cut the shaft and try to draw their fire."
"WEDGE";"Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-three degrees."
"RED LEADER";"I see. Stay down."
"LUKE";"This is Red Five! I'm going in!"
"BIGGS";"Luke, come up!"
"BIGGS";"Are you alright?"
"LUKE";"I was a little overcooked, but I'm fine."
"ASTRO-OFFICIAL";"We count thirty rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they are so small that they are running away from our turbo-lasers!"
"VADER";"We'll have to destroy them ship by ship. Take the crews to your fighters."
"RED LEADER";"Luke, let me know when you go in."
"LUKE";"I'm on my way..."
"RED LEADER";"Watch out! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower."
"LUKE";"I'm on it."
"CONTROL OFFICER";"Squadron Leaders, we've picked up a new set of signals. Enemy fighters heading your way."
"LUKE";"My aim is negative. I don't see anything."
"RED LEADER";"Keep your visual scan. With all this interference, they'll be on you before your scope can pick them up."
"RED LEADER";"Biggs! You got a...careful!"
"BIGGS";"I can't see it! Where is he?!"
"BIGGS";"He's on top of me tight, I can't shake him...can't shake him."
"LUKE";"Hold on, Biggs, I'm coming in."
"LUKE";"Got him!"
"VADER";"Several fighters broke away from the main group. Come with me!"
"BIGGS";"Pull! Luke...pull!"
"WEDGE";"Careful, Luke!"
"WEDGE";"Watch your back! The fighter is above you, coming!"
"LUKE";"I got hit, but not bad."
"LUKE";"Artoo, see what you can do with it. Wait back there."
"RED LEADER";"Red Six..."
"RED LEADER";"Can you see Red Five?"
"RED TEN";"There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you?"
"LUKE";"I can't shake him!"
"WEDGE";"I'm with him, Luke!"
"WEDGE";"Wait!"
"LUKE";"Damn! Shut up where you are?"
"LUKE";"Thanks, Wedge."
"BIGGS";"Good shot, Wedge!"
"GOLD LEADER";"Red Leader..."
"GOLD LEADER";"... This is Gold Leader. We are starting the attack race."
"RED LEADER";"I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position."
"VADER";"Stay in attack formation!"
"GOLD LEADER";"The exhaust post is..."
"GOLD LEADER";"...marked and blocked!"
"GOLD LEADER";"Change power to the front deflection screens."
"GOLD LEADER";"How many weapons do you think, Gold Five?"
"GOLD FIVE";"I'd say about twenty weapons. Some on the surface, some in the turrets."
"MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE";"The Death Star will be in range in five minutes."
"GOLD LEADER";"Switch to targeting computer."
"GOLD TWO";"Computer is locked. Getting a signal."
"GOLD TWO";"The guns... they stopped!"
"GOLD FIVE";"Stabilize your rear deflectors. Keep an eye out for enemy fighters."
"GOLD LEADER";"They're coming! Three marks at ten past two."
"VADER";"I'll take them myself! Cover me!"
"WINGMAN";"Yes, sir."
"GOLD LEADER";"Can't maneuver!"
"FIVE GOLD";"Stay on target."
"GOLDEN LEADER";"We are very close."
"FIVE GOLD";"Stay on target!"
"GOLD LEADER";"Loosen up!"
"GOLD FIVE";"Gold Five for Red Leader..."
"GOLD FIVE";"Lost Tiree, lost Dutch."
"RED LEADER";"I copy, Gold Five."
"GOLD FIVE";"They came from behind..."
"OFFICIAL";"We have analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship on standby?"
"TARKIN";"Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate the their chances!"
"VOICE";"Rebel base, three minutes and closing."
"RED LEADER";"Red Group, this is the Red Leader."
"RED LEADER";"Encounter at mark six point one."
"WEDGE";"This is Red Two. Flying towards you."
"BIGGS";"Three Reds, waiting."
"DODONNA";"Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half of your group out of range for the next race."
"RED LEADER";"Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Stay here and wait for my signal... to begin your run."
"RED LEADER";"That's it!"
"RED TEN";"We should be able to see him now."
"RED LEADER";"Keep your eyes peeled for these fighters!"
"RED TEN";"There's a lot of interference!"
"RED TEN";"Red Five, can you see them from where you are?"
"LUKE";"No sign of any... wait!"
"LUKE";"Arriving at point three and five."
"RED TEN";"I see them."
"RED LEADER";"I'm within range."
"RED LEADER";"Target is coming!"
"RED LEADER";"Just hold them for a few seconds."
"VADER";"Approximate formation."
"RED LEADER";"Almost there!"
"RED TEN";"You'd better let her go."
"RED LEADER";"Almost there!"
"RED TEN";"I can't hold them!"
"RED LEADER";"It's out!"
"RED NINE";"It's a success!"
"RED LEADER";"Negative."
"RED LEADER";"Negative! Didn't go in, just surfaced."
"LUKE";"Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to aim..."
"LUKE";"... oh-five; we've got it covered for you."
"RED LEADER";"Stay there..."
"RED LEADER";"... I just lost my starboard engine."
"RED LEADER";"Get ready for your attack rush."
"DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE";"Rebel base, one minute and closing."
"LUKE";"Biggs, Wedge, let's close. Let's go in. Let's go full throttle."
"WEDGE";"All right, boss."
"BIGGS";"Luke, at this speed will you be able to get out in time?"
"LUKE";"It will be just like Beggars Canyon at home."
"BIGGS";"We'll stay far enough away to cover you."
"WEDGE";"My crosshairs show the turret, but I can't see the exhaust outlet! Are you sure the computer can hit it?"
"LUKE";"Caution! Increase your speed to full throttle!"
"WEDGE";"And that tower?"
"LUKE";"You worry about these fighters! I worry about the tower!"
"LUKE";"Artoo...yes, that stabilizer is loose again! See if you can't lock it!"
"WEDGE";"I got hit! I can't be with you."
"LUKE";"Step back, Wedge."
"LUKE";"You can't do any more good back there!"
"WEDGE";"Sorry!"
"VADER";"Let him go! Stay in the leader!"
"BIGGS";"Hurry up Luke, they're coming a lot faster this time. I can't hold them back!"
"LUKE";"Artoo, try to power up!"
"BIGGS";"Hurry up, Luke!"
"BIGGS";"Wait!"
"DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE";"Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing."
"VADER";"I'm in the leader."
"THREEEPIO";"Hold on, Artoo!"
"BEN";"Use the Force, Luke."
"BEN";"Let go, Luke."
"VADER";"The Force is strong with this one!"
"BEN";"Luke, trust me."
"BASE VOICE";"His computer is off. Luke, you turned off the targeting computer. What's wrong?"
"LUKE";"Nothing. I'm fine."
"LUKE";"I lost Artoo!"
"MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE";"The Death Star cleared the planet. The Death Star cleared the planet."
"DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE";"Rebel base, within range."
"TARKIN";"You can shoot when you're ready."
"DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE";"Start primary ignition."
"VADER";"I have you now."
"VADER";"What?"
"HAN";"Yahoo!"
"WINGMAN";"Caution!"
"HAN";"You're fine, boy."
"HAN";"Now let's blow this thing up and go home!"
"VOICE OF INTERCOM";"Wait to shoot the Rebel base."
"INTERCOM VOICE";"Waiting."
"HAN";"Great photo, kid. That was one in a million."
"BEN";"Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
"READ";"Luke! Luke! Luke!"
"HAN";"Hey! Hey!"
"LUKE";"I knew you'd be back! I knew it!"
"HAN";"Well, I wasn't going to let you take all the credit and take all the reward."
"READ";"Hey, I knew you were more than money."
"LUKE";"Oh no!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh my God! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! You can fix it, can't you?"
"TECHNICIAN";"We will work on it immediately."
"THREEEPIO";"You must fix it! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears help, I will gladly donate them."
"LUKE";"He'll be fine."
