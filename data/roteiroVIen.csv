"SHUTTLE CAPTAIN";"Command station, this is ST 321. Code Blue Release. We are starting our approach. Disable the security shield."
"DEATH STAR CONTROLLER";"The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Please wait... You are cleared to proceed."
"SHUTTLE CAPTAIN";"We are starting our approach."
"OFFICIAL";"Inform the commander that Lord Vader's ship has arrived."
"OPERATOR";"Yes, sir."
"JERGERROD";"Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We are honored to have you."
"VADER";"You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to get you back on schedule."
"JERJERROD";"I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can."
"VADER";"Maybe I can find new ways to motivate them."
"JERJERROD";"I tell you, this station will be operational as planned."
"VADER";"The Emperor does not share your optimistic assessment of the situation."
"JERJERROD";"But he asks for the impossible. I need more men."
"VADER";"Then maybe you can tell him when he arrives."
"JERJERROD";"Is the Emperor coming here?"
"VADER";"Correct, Commander. And he is very unhappy with your apparent lack of progress."
"JERJERROD";"We will double our efforts."
"VADER";"I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am."
"THREEEPIO";"Of course I'm worried. And you should be too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never came back from this horrible place."
"THREEEPIO";"Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit."
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I'd better knock, I suppose."
"THREEEPIO";"Looks like no one is there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke."
"Strange Voice";"Tee kicks what hey!"
"THREEEPIO";"God give me grace!"
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo Detoowha bo See three piowha hey very strange mischka Jabba du Hutt."
"THREEEPIO";"I don't think they'll let us in, Artoo. We better go."
"THREE";"Artoo, wait. Oh, honey! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!"
"THREEEPIO";"Just deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my God! Oh! Oh, no."
"BIB";"Die Wanna Wanga!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh my God! Wauaga. We - we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt."
"THREEEPIO";"... and a gift. Gift, what gift?"
"BIB";"Nee Jabba no badda . Chaade me that good."
"THREEEPIO";"He says our instructions are to give only to Jabba himself."
"THREEEPIO";"I'm sorry. I'm afraid he's so stubborn about this sort of thing."
"BIB";" Nudd Chaa."
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this."
"THREEEPIO";"Good morning."
"JABBA";"Bo Shuda !"
"THREEEPIO";"The message, Artoo, the message."
"LUKE";"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend of Captain Solo. I know that you are mighty, mighty Jabba, and that your anger at Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Majesty to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I am sure we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial and allows us to avoid any unpleasant confrontations. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift : those two droids."
"THREEEPIO";"What did he say?"
"LUKE";"... Both are hardworking and will serve you well."
"THREEEPIO";"This can't be! Artoo, you're sending the wrong message."
"JABBA";"There will be no bargaining."
"THREEEPIO";"We are doomed."
"JABBA";"I won't give up my favorite decor. I like Captain Solo where he is."
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite."
"THREEEPIO";"What could have happened to Master Luke. Was it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Wait! Ohh!"
"NINEDENINE";"Ah, good. New acquisitions. You're a protocol droid, aren't you?"
"THREEEPIO";"I am See-Threepio, human-cy..."
"NINEDENINE";"Yes or no."
"THREEEPIO";"Ah. Well, yes."
"NINEDENINE";"How many languages ​​do you speak?"
"THREEEPIO";"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily..."
"NINEDENINE";"Splendid! We've been without an interpreter ever since our master got mad at our last protocol droid and disintegrated it."
"THREEEPIO";"Disintegrated?"
"NINEDENINE";"Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit it with a containment bolt and take it back to His Excellency's main audience chamber."
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!"
"NINEDENINE";"You're a grumpy child, but you'll soon learn some respect. I need you on the master's Sailing Barge. And I think you'll fit in just fine."
"JABBA";"From Eitha !"
"OOLA";"Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota..."
"JABBA";" Boska!"
"BOUSHH";"I have come for the reward for this Wookiee."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh no! Chewbacca!"
"JABBA";"Finally we have the mighty Chewbacca."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, uh, yes, uh, I'm here, Your Excellency. Uh...yes!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh. The illustrious Jabba welcomes you and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand."
"BOUSHH";"I want fifty thousand. Nothing less."
"THREEEPIO";"Uh, oh...but what, what did I say? Uh, mighty Jabba asks why he should pay fifty thousand."
"THREEEPIO";"Because he's holding a thermal detonator."
"JABBA";"This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive."
"THREEEPIO";"Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you accept."
"BOUSHH";" Zeebuss ."
"THREEEPIO";"He agrees!"
"BOUSHH";"Just relax for a moment. You are carbonite free."
"BOUSHH";"Shhh. You have hibernation sickness."
"HAN";"I can't see."
"BOUSHH";"Your vision will return in time."
"HAN";"Where am I?"
"BOUSHH";"Jabba's Palace."
"HAN";"Who are you?"
"READ";"Someone who loves you."
"HAN";"Read!"
"READ";"I have to get you out of here."
"HAN";"What is that? I know that laugh."
"HAN";"Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was going to pay you back, but I strayed a little. It's not my fault."
"JABBA";"It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha ration."
"HAN";"Look..."
"JABBA";"Take him away!"
"HAN";"Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be silly!"
"JABBA";"Bring her to me."
"READ";"We have powerful friends. You will regret this..."
"JABBA";"I'm sure."
"READ";"Ugh!"
"THREEEPIO";"Ohhh, I can't stand to watch it."
"HAN";"Chewie? Chewie, is that you?"
"HAN";"Ah! Chew--Chewie!"
"HAN";"Wait. I can't see it, friend. What's going on?"
"HAN";"Luke? Luke is crazy. He can't even take care of himself, let alone rescue someone."
"HAN";"Um...Jedi Knight? I - I'm out of it for a while, everyone has delusions of grandeur."
"HAN";"I'm fine, friend. I'm fine."
"LUKE";"I need to talk to Jabba."
"LUKE";"You're taking me to Jabba now!"
"LUKE";"You serve your master well."
"LUKE";"And you will be rewarded."
"THREEEPIO";"Finally! Master Luke came to rescue me."
"BIB";"Master."
"BIB";"...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight."
"JABBA";"I told you not to admit it."
"LUKE";"I must be allowed to speak."
"BIB";"He must be able to speak."
"JABBA";"You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick."
"LUKE";"You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me."
"JABBA";"Your mental powers won't work on me, boy."
"LUKE";"Still, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can profit from it... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers."
"THREEEPIO";"Master Luke, you are standing..."
"JABBA";"There will be no bargaining, young Jedi. I'll enjoy watching you die."
"JABBA";" Enough !"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh no! The Grudge!"
"JABBA";"Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage."
"LUKE";"Han!"
"HAN";"Luke!"
"LUKE";"Are you okay?"
"HAN";"Alright. Together again, huh?"
"LUKE";"Wouldn't miss it."
"HAN";"How are we doing?"
"LUKE";"Same as always."
"HAN";"So bad, huh? Where's Leia?"
"READ";"I'm here."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, dear. His High Exaltation, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you must be exterminated immediately."
"HAN";"Well, I hate long waits."
"THREEEPIO";"You will therefore be taken to the Sea of ​​Dunes and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting ground of the almighty Sarlacc."
"HAN";"It doesn't look too bad."
"THREEEPIO";"In his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."
"HAN";"On second thought, let's pass it on, huh?"
"LUKE";"You should have traded, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll make."
"HAN";"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big blur of light."
"LUKE";"There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know."
"HAN";"You're going to die here, you know. Convenient."
"LUKE";"Just stay close to Chewie and Lando. I took care of everything."
"HAN";"Ah...great!"
"JABBA";"You'll soon learn to appreciate me."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, I'm sorry... Artoo! What are you doing here?"
"THREEEPIO";"Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They'll execute Master Luke, and if we're not careful, so will we!"
"THREEEPIO";"Hmm. I wish I had your trust."
"THREEEPIO";"Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency expects you to die honorably. But if any of you wish to beg for mercy, great Jabba the Hutt will now hear your pleas."
"HAN"; "Threepio, tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth that he won't get as much pleasure from us. Right?"
"LUKE";"Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die."
"JABBA";"Move it into position."
"JABBA";"Put the inside."
"LUKE";"Calm down, Chewie."
"LANDO";"Hey! Hey! Help!"
"HAN";"Chewie, are you okay? Where is he?"
"HAN";"I'm fine, friend."
"LANDO";"Han! Chewie?"
"HAN";" Lando !"
"HAN";"Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?"
"HAN";" Lando, take it!"
"LANDO";"Get down!"
"HAN";"I'm trying!"
"HAN";"Hey! Hey! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping."
"HAN";"Grab it! L-- Lando . Grab it!"
"HAN";"Grab it! Almost... You almost made it!"
"LANDO";"Wait! Wow!"
"HAN";"Gently now. All... all right. Easy, easy now. Hold me, Chewie."
"HAN";"Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando."
"LANDO";"No, wait! I thought you were blind!"
"HAN";"It's okay. Trust me. Don't move."
"LANDO";"Alright! A little louder! Just a little louder!"
"HAN";"Chewie, pull us up! Let's go! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
"READ";"Let's go. We have to get out of here fast."
"THREEEPIO";"Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quick, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!"
"LUKE";"Get the gun! Aim for the deck!"
"LUKE";"Aim for the deck!"
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't jump."
"LUKE";"Let's go!"
"LUKE";"Come on! And don't forget the droids."
"LANDO";"We're on our way."
"HAN";"I don't know. All I can see is a bunch of blown sand!"
"READ";"That's all any of us can see."
"HAN";"Then I think I'm getting better."
"HAN";"I have to admit, kid, you were really good out there."
"LUKE";"I had a lot of help. Don't think about anything."
"HAN";"No, I've been thinking about it a lot. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to death there is. And it wasn't just sleeping. It was a big waking nothing!"
"LUKE";"See you in the fleet."
"HAN";"Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?"
"LUKE";"I have a promise I must keep first... to an old friend."
"HAN";"I guess I owe you some thanks too, Lando."
"LANDO";"I figured if I left you frozen like that you'd only bring me bad luck for the rest of my life, so I'd better unfreeze you sooner or later."
"READ";"He means You're welcome."
"LANDO";"Come on, let's get out of this wretched ball of dust."
"LUKE";"Meet you in the fleet."
"READ";"Quickly. The Alliance should already be assembled."
"LUKE";"I will."
"HAN";"Hey Luke, thanks. Thanks for coming after me. Now I owe you one."
"LUKE";"That's right, Artoo. We're heading to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend."
"EMPEROR";"Stand up, my friend."
"VADER";"The Death Star will be completed on time."
"EMPEROR";"You did well, Lord Vader. And now I feel that you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker."
"VADER";"Yes, my Master."
"EMPEROR";"Patience, my friend. In time he will look for you. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown stronger. Only together can we turn him into the dark side of the Force. . "
"VADER";"As you wish."
"EMPEROR";"Everything is happening as I predicted."
"YODA";"Hmm. That face you make. Do I look too old to young eyes?"
"LUKE";"No... of course not."
"YODA";"Yes, yes! Sick I've become. Old and weak. When I reach nine hundred, it won't look so pretty. Hmm?"
"YODA";"I'll rest soon. Yes, sleep forever. Won, I have."
"LUKE";"Master Yoda, you cannot die."
"YODA";"Strong am I with the Force...but not so much! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things...the way of the Force."
"LUKE";"But I need your help. I came back to complete the training."
"YODA";"You don't need any more training. You already know what you need."
"LUKE";"So I'm a Jedi?"
"YODA";"Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, will you be a Jedi. And you will face him."
"LUKE";"Master Yoda... Is Darth Vader my father?"
"YODA";"Mmm...rest I need. Yes...rest."
"LUKE";"Yoda, I need to know."
"YODA";"Your father he is."
"YODA";"Told you, didn't I?"
"LUKE";"Yes."
"YODA";"This is unexpected, and unfortunate.."
"LUKE";"Unfortunate that I know the truth?"
"YODA";"No. Unfortunately you ran to face him... that training was incomplete. You weren't ready for the burden."
"LUKE";"Well, I'm sorry."
"YODA";"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side is them. Once you start walking the dark path, forever it will dominate your destiny ."
"YODA";"Luke...Luke...No...Don't underestimate the Emperor's powers, or you will suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when I'm gone I, the last of the Jedi you will be Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you've learned, Luke... There is... another... Heaven... Heaven... Wanderer."
"LUKE";"I can't do this, Artoo. I can't go on alone."
"BEN";"Yoda will always be with you."
"LUKE";"Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?"
"LUKE";"You told me that Vader betrayed and murdered my father."
"BEN";"Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He stopped being Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was his father was destroyed. So what I told you was true... from a certain point of view."
"LUKE";"A certain point of view!"
"BEN";"Luke, you will find that many of the truths we cling to depend heavily on our own point of view."
"BEN";"I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been the first time. See, what happened to your father was my fault."
"BEN";"Anakin was a good friend."
"BEN";"When I met him, his father was already a great pilot. But I was impressed by the strength of the Force with him. I decided to train him as a Jedi. I thought I could instruct him as well as Yoda. wrong. My pride had dire consequences for the galaxy."
"LUKE";"There are still good things in him."
"BEN";"I also thought he might turn to the good side. It couldn't be done. He's more machine now than man. Twisted and evil."
"LUKE";"I can't do this, Ben."
"BEN";"You can't escape your fate."
"LUKE";"I tried to stop him once. I couldn't."
"BEN";"Vader humiliated you when you first met him, Luke... Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared."
"LUKE";"But I had to help my friends."
"BEN";"And you helped them? They were the ones who had to save you. You've accomplished little by returning prematurely, I'm afraid."
"LUKE";"I found out that Darth Vader was my father."
"BEN";"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must face and go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get through. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you stood your ground. You are not so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!"
"LUKE";"I can't kill my own father."
"BEN";"So the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope."
"LUKE";"Yoda spoke of another."
"BEN";"The other one he spoke of is his twin sister."
"LUKE";"But I don't have a sister."
"BEN";"Hmm. To protect you two from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, that if Anakin had children, they would be a threat to him. That's the reason why his sister remains securely anonymous."
"LUKE";"Read! Leia is my sister."
"BEN";"Your perception serves you well. Bury your feelings deep inside, Luke. They give you credit. But they can be made to serve the Emperor."
"BEN";"When your dad left, he didn't know your mom was pregnant. Your mom and I knew he'd find out eventually, but we wanted to keep the two of you as safe as possible, for as long as possible. So I took her to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and her mother took Leia to live as Senator Organa's daughter on Alderaan."
"BEN";"The Organa family was well-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of her bloodline...no one knew she had been adopted, of course. But it was a title. with no real power, since Alderaan had been a democracy for a long time. Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her adoptive father's path, became a senator as well. That's not all she became, of course. ...she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link in getting information for the Rebel cause. That's what she was doing when her path crossed the her... for her foster parents always told her to contact me on Tatooine if her problems became desperate."
"LUKE";"But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her."
"BEN";"She was not trained in the ways of the Jedi like you, Luke... You must face and destroy Vader!"
"HAN";"Well, look at you, a general, huh?"
"LANDO";"Ah well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver in the Battle of Taanab."
"HAN";"Well don't look at me buddy. I just said you were a good pilot. I didn't know they were looking for someone to lead this crazy attack."
"LANDO";"I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do this."
"HAN";"Well, who said no. But I'm not crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?"
"MON MOTHMA";"The Emperor has made a critical mistake and it's time for our attack."
"MON MOTHMA";"Data brought to us by Bothan spies indicates the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that this Death Star's weapons systems are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet scattered far and wide. the galaxy in a vain effort to envelop us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we learn that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this death star."
Death's Relation."
"MON MOTHMA";"Too many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please."
"ACKBAR";"You can see the Death Star here orbiting the forest moon of Endor. Although this Death Star's weapon systems are not operational yet, the Death Star has a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by a shield energy, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attacks are attempted. Once the shield is dropped, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to take down outside the main reactor."
"ACKBAR";"General Calrissian volunteered to lead the fighter attack"
"HAN";"Good luck."
"HAN";"You will need it."
"ACKBAR";"General Madine ."
"GENERAL MADINE";"We have stolen a small Imperial ship. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and disable the shield generator."
"THREEEPIO";"Looks dangerous."
"READ";"I wonder who they found to do this."
"GENERAL MADINE";"General Solo, is your strike team assembled?"
"HAN";"Uh, my team is ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle."
"HAN";"Well, it's going to be hard, buddy. I didn't want to speak for you."
"HAN";"It's one."
"READ";"Uh, General... count on me."
"VOICE";"I'm with you too!"
"READ";"What is it?"
"LUKE";"Ask me again sometime."
"HAN";"Luke."
"LUKE";"Hi, Han... Chewie."
"THREEEPIO";"\"
"HAN";"Look. I want you to take her. I'm serious. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet."
"LANDO";"It's okay, old friend. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. Is that okay?"
"HAN"; "Right. Got promise from her now. Not a scratch."
"LANDO";"Look, go ahead, you pirate."
"LANDO";"Good luck."
"HAN";"You too."
"HAN";"Did you warm her up?"
"LUKE";"Yes, she's coming."
"HAN";"No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed it, Chewie."
"READ";"Hey, are you awake?"
"HAN";"Yeah, I just have a funny feeling. Like I won't see her again."
"READ";"Come on, general, let's go."
"HAN";"Okay. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, guys?"
"LUKE";"All set."
"THREEEPIO";"Here we go again."
"HAN";"Alright, wait."
"VADER";"What is your order, my Master?"
"EMPEROR";"Send the fleet to the other side of Endor. There it will remain until called."
"VADER";"And the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?"
"EMPEROR";"Not a worry. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is done, my friend. Go to the command ship and await my orders."
"VADER";"Yes, my Master."
"HAN";"If they don't, we're going to have to get out of here real quick, Chewie."
"CONTROLLER";"We have you on our screen now. Please identify yourself."
"HAN";"Shuttle Tydirium requesting deflect shield deactivation."
"CONTROLLER";"Shuttle Tydirium , transmit the release code to pass the shield."
"HAN";"Start of transmission."
"READ";"Now let's find out if that code is worth the price we paid."
"HAN";"It will work. It will work."
"LUKE";"Vader is on that ship."
"HAN";"Now don't be nervous, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance."
"HAN";"I don't know. Fly casual."
"LUKE";"I'm putting the mission in jeopardy. I shouldn't have come."
"HAN";"It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep some optimism here."
"VADER";"Where is this ship going?"
"PIETT";"Shuttle Tydirium , what is your cargo and destination?"
"PILOT VOICE";"Parts and crew for the forest moon."
"VADER";"Do they have a code authorization?"
"PIETT";"It's an older code sir, but check it out. I was just about to clean them up."
"PIETT";"Should I hold them?"
"VADER";"No. Leave them to me. I'll deal with them myself."
"PIETT";"As you wish, my lord. Continue."
"HAN";"They won't do that, Chewie."
"CONTROLLER";"Shuttle Tydirium , shield deactivation will begin immediately. Follow your current course."
"HAN";"Okay! I said it would work. No problem."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here."
"READ";"Shall we try to go for a walk?"
"HAN";"It will take time. This whole party will be worthless if they see us."
"HAN";"Chewie and I will take care of it. You stay here."
"LUKE";"Quietly, there might be more of them out there."
"HAN";"Hey...it's me."
"SCOUT #1";"Go for help! Go!"
"LUKE";"Fine. Let's go."
"READ";"Over there! Two more!"
"LUKE";"I see them. Wait, Leia!"
"LUKE";"Quick! Block their comlink. Main switch!"
"HAN";"Hey, wait! Ahhh !"
"LUKE";"Come closer!"
"LUKE";"Stand by that one!"
"LUKE";"Get him!"
"LUKE";"Keep it up! I'll take these two!"
"THREEPIO";"Oh, General Solo, someone is coming. Oh!"
"HAN";"Luke! Where's Leia?"
"LUKE";"What? She hasn't come back?"
"HAN";"I thought she was with you."
"LUKE";"We broke up."
"LUKE";"Hey, we better go find her."
"HAN";"Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300."
"LUKE";"Come on, Artoo. We're going to need your scanners."
"THREEEPIO";"Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do."
"THREEEPIO";"And you said it was beautiful here. Ugh!"
"READ";"Stop it!"
"READ";"I won't hurt you."
"READ";"Well, it looks like I'm stuck here. Problem is, I don't know where it is."
"READ";"Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down."
"READ";"I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here."
"READ";"Alright. Want something to eat?"
"READ";"That's right. Let's go. Hmmm?"
"READ";"Look, it's a hat. It won't hurt you. Look. You're a nervous little thing, aren't you?"
"READ";"What is it?"
"SCOUT #1";"Freeze! Come on, get up!"
"SCOUT #1";"Go get your ride and take it back to base."
"SCOUT #2";"Yes, sir."
"READ";"Come on, let's get out of here."
"GUARD";"Stop! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment."
"VADER";"The Emperor will see me now!"
"GUARD";"The Emperor will see you, now."
"EMPEROR";"I told you to stay on the command ship."
"VADER";"A small rebel force penetrated the shield and landed on Endor."
"EMPEROR";"Yes, I know."
"VADER";"My son is with them."
"EMPEROR";"Are you sure?"
"VADER";"I felt it, my Master."
"EMPEROR";"Strange that I haven't. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader."
"VADER";"They are clear, my Master."
"EMPEROR";"Then you must go to the Sanctuary of the Moon and wait for them."
"VADER";"Will he come to me?"
"EMPEROR"; "I foresaw this. His compassion for you will be your undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me."
"VADER";"As you wish."
"HAN";"Luke! Luke!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, Master Luke."
"LUKE";"There are two more speeders destroyed back there. And I found this."
"THREEEPIO";"I'm afraid Artoo's sensors find no trace of Princess Leia."
"HAN";"I hope she's okay."
"HAN";"What, Chewie? What? Chewie!"
"HAN";"Hey, I don't understand."
"HAN";"No, it's just a dead animal, Chewie."
"LUKE";"Chewie, wa - wait! No!"
"HAN";"Good job. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with my stomach."
"LUKE";"Are you taking it easy? Let's just figure out a way out of this thing. Han, can you reach for my lightsaber?"
"HAN";"Yes, of course."
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo, I'm not sure this is a good idea. It's a very long dro -o -op!!"
"HAN";" What... ? Hey! Point that thing away."
"HAN";"Hey!"
"LUKE";"Han, don't do that. It'll be okay."
"LUKE";"Chewie, give them your crossbow."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, my head. Oh, my God!"
"LUKE";"Do you understand something they are saying?"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication."
"HAN";"What are you telling them?"
"THREEEPIO";"Hello, I think... I could be wrong. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I believe they think I'm some kind of god."
"HAN";"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"
"THREEEPIO";"I apologize, General Solo, but that would not be appropriate."
"HAN";"Appropriate?!"
"THREEEPIO";"It's against my programming to impersonate a deity."
"HAN";"Why, you--"
"HAN";"My mistake. He's an old friend of mine."
"HAN";"I have a bad feeling about this."
"HAN";"What did he say?"
"THREEEPIO";"I am quite embarrassed, General Solo, but it looks like you will be the main course of a feast in my honor."
"HAN and LUKE";"Read!"
"READ";"Ah!"
"THREEEPIO";"Your Royal Highness."
"READ"; "But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be released."
"HAN";"Somehow I got the feeling that it didn't help us much."
"LUKE"; "Threepio, tell them that if they don't do what you want, you'll get angry and use your magic."
"THREEEPIO";"But Master Luke, what magic?"
"LUKE";"Just tell them."
"THREEEPIO";"You see, Master Luke, they didn't believe me. Just..."
"THREEEPIO";"...like I said they wouldn't. What--what--what's going on! Oh! Oh, honey! Oh!"
"THREEEPIO";"Put me down! E-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Someone, someone, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quick! Do something, someone! Oh! Ohhh!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank God."
"LUKE";"Thanks, Threepio ."
"THREEEPIO";"I... I never knew I had that in me."
"THREEEPIO";"Yes, Artoo. I was just getting there."
"HAN";"What's going on?"
"READ";"I don't know."
"THREEEPIO";"Wonderful! We are now part of the tribe."
"HAN";"Exactly what I always wanted."
"HAN";"Well, a short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thanks. Okay."
"THREEEPIO";"He says the scouts will show us the fastest way to the shield generator."
"HAN";"Good. What is the distance? you to him. We need some new supplies too. And try to get our weapons back."
"HAN";"And hurry up, yes? I don't have all day."
"LUKE";"Luke, what's wrong?"
"LUKE";"Read... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?"
"READ";"Just a little bit. She died when I was very young."
"LUKE";"What do you remember?"
"READ";"Just... images, really. Feelings."
"LUKE";"Tell me."
"READ";"She was very pretty. Kind but... sad. Why are you asking me all this?"
"LUKE";"I don't remember my mother. I never met her."
"READ";"Luke, tell me. What's bothering you?"
"LUKE";"Vader is here... now, on this moon."
"READ";"How do you know?"
"LUKE";"I felt his presence. He came to me. He can feel when I'm close. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm jeopardizing the group and our mission here. it."
"READ";"Why?"
"LUKE";"He's my father."
"READ";"Your father?"
"LUKE";"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear, but you must. If I don't come back, you're the only hope for the Alliance."
"READ";"Luke, don't talk like that. You have a power that I... I don't understand and could never have."
"LUKE";"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it like I do. The Force is strong in my family. My father has... I have... it... and... my sister has it."
"LUKE";"Yes. It's you Leia."
"READ";"I know. Somehow...I always knew."
"LUKE";"Then you know why I have to face him."
"READ";"No! Luke, run away. If he can feel your presence, then get out of this place. I wish I could go with you."
"LUKE";"No, not you. You were always strong."
"READ";"But why should you confront him?"
"LUKE";"Because... there's something good in him. I felt it. He won't hand me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can bring him back to the good side. You have to try."
"HAN";"Hey, what's going on?"
"READ";"Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a while."
"HAN";"Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's going on?"
"READ";"I...I can't tell you."
"HAN";"Did you tell Luke? Is that what you could tell?"
"READ";"I..."
"HAN";" Ahhh..."
"HAN";"I'm sorry."
"READ";"Hold me."
"COMMANDER";"This is a rebel who has surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I ask permission to conduct a new search of the area."
"COMMANDER";"He was armed with just this."
"VADER";"Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring your companions to me."
"COMMANDER";"Yes, my Lord."
"VADER";"The Emperor was waiting for you."
"LUKE";"I know, Dad."
"VADER";"So you've accepted the truth."
"LUKE";"I have accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father."
"VADER";"This name has no more meaning to me."
"LUKE";"It's the name of your true self. You just forgot. I know there's something good in you. The Emperor hasn't completely taken it from you. That's why you can't destroy me. . That's why that you will not take me to your emperor now."
"VADER";"I see you've built a new lightsaber."
"VADER";"Your abilities are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor predicted."
"LUKE";"Come with me."
"VADER";"Obi-Wan has already thought like you."
"VADER";"You do not know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master."
"LUKE";"I will not turn... and you will be forced to kill me."
"VADER";"If that's your fate."
"LUKE";"Look for your feelings, father. You can't do that. I feel the conflict inside you. Let go of your hate."
"VADER";"It's too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now."
"LUKE";"So my father is really dead."
"READ";"The main entrance to the control bunker is on the other side of the landing pad. This won't be easy."
"HAN";"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and I have entered many more heavily guarded places than this."
"READ";"What is he saying?"
"THREEEPIO";"He says there is a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge."
"LANDO";"Admiral, we are in position. All fighters have been accounted for."
"ACKBAR";"Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume the attack coordinates."
"LANDO";"Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll drop the shield in time...or this will be the shortest offensive ever."
"ACKBAR";"All ships, prepare to jump into hyperspace on my mark."
"LANDO";"Alright. Wait."
"HAN";"Back door, huh? Good idea."
"HAN";"It's just a few guards. That shouldn't be too much trouble."
"READ";"Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm."
"HAN";"Then let's do it very quietly."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!"
"READ";"Silent."
"THREEEPIO";"I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash."
"READ";"Oh, no."
"HAN";"There goes our surprise attack."
"SCOUT";"Look! Over there! Stop him!"
"HAN";"Not bad for a small hairball. Only one remains. You stay here. We'll take care of that."
"THREEEPIO";"I've decided that we're going to stay here."
"EMPEROR";"Welcome, young Skywalker. I've been waiting for you."
"EMPEROR";"You don't need it anymore."
"EMPEROR";"Guards, leave us."
"EMPEROR";"I look forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master."
"LUKE";"You are gravely mistaken. You will not convert me like you did my father."
"EMPEROR";"Oh no, my young Jedi. You will find that you are the one who is wrong... about many things."
"VADER";"Your lightsaber."
"EMPEROR";"Ah yes, a Jedi weapon. Much like your father's. By now you should know that your father can never be taken from the dark side. So shall it be with you."
"LUKE";"You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead... and you with me."
"EMPEROR";"Perhaps you refer to the impending attack of your Rebel fleet."
"EMPEROR";"Yes... I assure you that we are safe from your friends here."
"LUKE";"Your overconfidence is your weakness."
"EMPEROR";"Your faith in your friends is yours."
"VADER";"It is useless to resist, my son."
"EMPEROR";"Everything that happened was done according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon..."
"EMPEROR";"...they are walking into a trap. So is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. legion of my finest troops await them."
"EMPEROR";"Ah... I'm afraid the deflector shield will be well operational when your friends arrive."
"HAN";"All right! Up! Move! Let's go! Quick! Quick, Chewie."
"READ";"Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any minute now."
"HAN";"Charges! Come on, come on!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, my! They will be captured!"
"THREEEPIO";" Wa -wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me."
"COMMANDER";"Stop! You rebel scum."
"LANDO";"All wards report."
"WEDGE";"Red Leader waiting."
"GRAY LEADER";"Grey Leader waiting."
"GREEN LEADER";"Green Leader waiting."
"WEDGE";"Block S-foils in attack positions."
"ACKBAR";"May the Force be with us."
"LANDO";"We have to get some kind of reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how can they be getting in our way if they don't know if we're coming."
"LANDO";"Stop the attack! The shield is still up."
"RED LEADER";"Can't read. Are you sure?"
"LANDO";"Pull up! All vessels stop!"
"ACKBAR";"Take evasive action! Green Group, stay close to MV-7 sector."
"CONTROLLER";"Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47."
"ACKBAR";"It's a trap!"
"LANDO";"Fighters Coming."
"REBEL PILOT";"There are too many of them!"
"LANDO";"Accelerate to attack speed! Keep fire away from cruisers."
"WEDGE";"Copy, Gold Leader."
"EMPEROR";"Come, lad. See for yourself."
"EMPEROR";"From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance and the end of your petty Rebellion."
"EMPEROR";"You want it, don't you? Hate is building in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Hit me with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you become my servant more."
"LUKE";"No!"
"EMPEROR";"It's inevitable. It's your fate. You, as your father, are now mine!"
"STORMTROOPER";"Alright, move! I said move! Go ahead!"
"THREEEPIO";"Hello! I mean, over there! Were you looking for me?"
"BUNKER COMMANDER";"Bring those two down!"
"STORMTROOPER";"Let's go!"
"THREEEPIO";"Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure it was a good idea?"
"STORMTROOPER";"Freeze! Don't move!"
"THREEEPIO";"We surrender."
"THREEEPIO";" Ohhh ! Back off, Artoo."
"READ";"The code has changed. We need Artoo!"
"HAN";"Here is the terminal."
"READ";"Artoo, where are you? We need you in the bunker immediately."
"THREEEPIO";"Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!"
"LANDO";"Careful, Wedge! Top three!"
"WEDGE";"Red Three, Red Two, pull!"
"RED TWO";"Got it!"
"RED THREE";"Three of them coming, twenty degrees!"
"WEDGE";"Cut to the left! I'll get the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate."
"BROWSER";"The pressure is stable."
"LANDO";"Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what these Star Destroyers are waiting for."
"COMMANDER";"We are in attack position now, sir."
"PIETT";"Wait here."
"COMMANDER";"We're not going to attack?"
"PIETT";"I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We just need to stop them from escaping."
"EMPEROR";"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander."
"JERJERROD";"Fire!"
"LANDO";"That explosion came from the Death Star! This thing is operational! Home One, this is the Gold Leader."
"ACKBAR";"We've seen it. All ships prepare to retreat."
"LANDO";"You won't get another chance at it, Admiral."
"ACKBAR";"We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers cannot repel firepower of this magnitude."
"LANDO";"Han will have that shield down. We have to give him more time."
"THREEEPIO";"We're coming!"
"HAN";"Let's go! Let's go!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, Artoo, quick!"
"THREEEPIO";"My God! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?"
"HAN";"Well, I suppose I could turn that thing on."
"READ";"I'll cover you."
"LANDO";"Yes! I said closer! Get as close as you can and face those Star Destroyers at point blank range."
"ACKBAR";"At this distance, we won't last long against these Star Destroyers."
"LANDO";"We'll last longer than we do against the Death Star... and we can take some of them with us."
"REBEL PILOT";"She's going to explode!"
"Y-WING PILOT";"I got hit!"
"EMPEROR";"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the moon of Endor will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die... as will your friends."
"EMPEROR";"Good. I can feel your anger. I am helpless. Take your weapon! Take me down with all your hate, and your journey to the dark side will be complete."
"PILOT WALKER #1";"Look!"
"PILOT #2";"Get him out of there!"
"HAN";"I think I got it. Got it!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh Princess Leia, are you alright?"
"HAN";"Let's see."
"READ";"Not bad."
"STORMTROOPER";"Freeze!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh dear."
"STORMTROOPER";"Don't move!"
"HAN";"I love you."
"READ";"I know."
"STORMTROOPER";"Hands up! Get up!"
"HAN";"Stay back."
"HAN";"Chewie! Get down here! She's hurt! No, wait... I have an idea."
"EMPEROR";"Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you."
"VADER";"Obi-Wan taught you well."
"LUKE";"I won't fight you dad."
"VADER";"You are reckless to lower your defenses."
"LUKE";"Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you... the conflict."
"VADER";"There is no conflict."
"LUKE";"You couldn't kill me before, and I don't think you're going to destroy me now."
"VADER";"You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you don't fight, then you will meet your destiny."
"EMPEROR";"Good. Good."
"LANDO";"Caution. Squad at 0.06."
"REBEL PILOT";"I'm on it, Gold Leader."
"WEDGE";"Good shot, Red Two."
"LANDO";"Now... come on, Han, old friend. Don't let me down."
"HAN/PILOT";"It's over, Commander. The rebels have been defeated. They are fleeing into the forest. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit."
"CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER";"Send three squads to help. Open the back door."
"SECOND COMMANDER";"Yes, sir."
"HAN";"Throw me another load."
"VADER";"You can't hide forever, Luke."
"LUKE";"I won't fight you."
"VADER";"Surrender to the dark side. It's the only way to save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for..."
"VADER";"Sister! So... you have a twin. Your feelings have now betrayed you too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide you from me. Now his failure is complete. If you don't transform to the dark side, so maybe she will."
"LUKE";"Never-rr!"
"EMPEROR";"Good! Your hatred has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place by my side!"
"LUKE";"Never! I will never turn to the dark side. You failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me."
"EMPEROR";"So be it... Jedi."
"HAN";"Move! Move!"
"ACKBAR";"The shield has fallen! Begin the attack on the Death Star's main reactor."
"LANDO";"We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all the fighters follow me. Said they would do it!"
"EMPEROR";"If you are not transformed, you will be destroyed."
"EMPEROR";"Young fool... only now, in the end, do you understand."
"EMPEROR";"Your weak skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You paid the price for your lack of vision."
"LUKE";"Dad, please. Help me."
"EMPEROR";"Now, young Skywalker...you will die."
"WEDGE";"I will enter."
"LANDO";"Here goes nothing."
"LANDO";"Now lock onto the strongest power source. It must be the power generator."
"WEDGE";"Form up. And stay alert. We can run out of space very quickly."
"LANDO";"Split up and go back to the surface. See if you can get some of those TIE fighters to follow you."
"PILOT";"Copy, Gold Leader."
"LANDO";"That was too close."
"ACKBAR";"We have to give these fighters more time. Focus all fire on that Super Star Destroyer."
"CONTROLLER";"Sir, we lost our bridge deflector shield."
"PIETT";"Step up the front batteries. I don't want anything to happen."
"PIETT";"Intensify forward firepower!"
"COMMANDER";"It's too late!"
"VADER";"Luke, help me take off this mask."
"LURE";"But you will die."
"VADER";"Nothing can stop this now. Just for once...let me look at you with my own eyes."
"ANAKIN";"Now... go, my son. Leave me."
"LUKE";"No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here and save."
"ANAKIN";"You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right."
"LUKE";"Dad...I won't let you."
"WEDGE";"There it is!"
"LANDO";"Alright, Wedge. Go to the power regulator in the north tower."
"WEDGE";"Copy, Golden Leader. I'm leaving."
"ACKBAR";"Move the fleet away from the Death Star."
"LANDO";"Cunha, I don't think we'll make it."
"WEDGE";"You'll make it. Just follow me Gold Leader."
"LANDO";"I promised to return the ship without a scratch... I hope that old pirate will forgive me."
"HAN";"Lando..."
"THREEEPIO";"They did it!"
