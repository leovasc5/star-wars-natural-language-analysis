"LUKE";"Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old friend, do you read me?"
"HAN";"Loud and clear, kid. What's up?"
"LUKE";"Well, I've finished my circle. I don't get any life readings."
"HAN";"There's not enough life in this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are in place. I'll be back."
"LUKE";"Alright. See you soon. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't be long."
"LUKE";"Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? Do you smell something?"
"LUKE";"Aaargh!"
"HAN";"Chewie!"
"HAN";"Alright, don't lose your cool. I'll be right back and give you a hand."
"RIEEKAN";"Alone?"
"HAN";"No signs of life out there, General. Sensors are in place. You'll know if anything happens."
"RIEEKAN";"Has Commander Skywalker arrived yet?"
"HAN";"No. He's checking a meteorite that landed near him."
"RIEEKAN";"With all the meteor activity in this system, it will be difficult to detect approaching ships."
"HAN";"General, I have to go. I can't stay any longer."
"RIEEKAN";"Sorry to hear that."
"HAN";"Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man."
"RIEEKAN";"A deathmark is not an easy thing to live with. You are a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you."
"HAN";"Thank you, General."
"HAN";"Well, Your Highness, I think that's it."
"READ";"That's right."
"HAN";"Well, don't get all soft on me. See you later, Princess."
"READ";"Han!"
"HAN";"Yes, Your Highness?"
"READ";"I thought you decided to stay."
"HAN";"Well, the bounty hunter we found in Ord Mantell changed my mind."
"READ";"Han, we need you!"
"HAN";"We?"
"READ";"Yes."
"HAN";"Oh, what do you need?"
"READ";"Need it? I don't know what you're talking about."
"HAN";"You probably don't."
"READ";"And what exactly should I know?"
"HAN";"Come on! You want me to stay because of how you feel about me."
"READ";"Yes. You are a great help to us. You are a natural leader..."
"HAN";"No! It's not that. Let's go. Aahhh -- uh huh! Let's go."
"READ";"You're imagining things."
"HAN";"Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I'll leave without kissing you goodbye?"
"READ";"I'd rather kiss a Wookiee."
"HAN";"I can arrange that. You need a good kiss!"
"THREEEPIO";"Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I just commented that it was freezing in the princess's room. But it should be freezing. How are we going to dry all her clothes? I really don't know." "
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, hang up."
"HAN";"Why do you take it apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of us."
"THREEEPIO";"Excuse me, sir."
"HAN";"Put them back together right now."
"THREEEPIO";"Can I have a word with you, please?"
"HAN";"What do you want?"
"THREEEPIO";"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's trying to get you on the communicator."
"HAN";"I hung up. I don't want to talk to her."
"THREEEPIO";"Ah. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He's not back yet. She doesn't know where he is."
"HAN";"I don't know where he is."
"THREEEPIO";"Nobody knows where he is."
"HAN";"What do you mean by \"
"THREEEPIO";"Well, uh, you see..."
"HAN";"Deck officer. Deck officer!"
"THREEEPIO";"Excuse me, sir. May I enqui-..."
"DECK OFFICER";"Yes sir?"
"HAN";"Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?"
"DECK OFFICER";"I didn't see him. It's possible he entered through the south entrance."
"HAN";"Is it possible? Why don't you find out? It's getting dark outside."
"DECK OFFICER";"Yes, sir."
"THREEEPIO";"Excuse me sir. May I ask what's going on?"
"HAN";"Why not?"
"THREEEPIO";"Impossible man. Come, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
"DECK OFFICER";"Sir, Commander Skywalker did not enter through the south entrance. He may have forgotten to check in."
"HAN";"Not likely. Are the speeders ready?"
"DECK OFFICER";"Not yet. We're having trouble adapting them to the cold."
"HAN";"Then we'll have to go out in Tauntauns."
"DECK OFFICER";"Sir, the temperature is dropping too fast."
"HAN";"That's right. And my friends out there."
"ASSISTANT OFFICER";"I'll cover sector twelve. Have the controller set the alpha screen."
"DECK OFFICER";"Your Tauntaun will freeze before you reach the first marker."
"HAN";"Then I'll see you in hell!"
"THREEEPIO";"You must come now, Artoo. There's really nothing else we can do. And my joints are freezing."
"THREEEPIO";"Don't say things like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be fine, you'll see. Stupid short circuit. He'll be fine."
"LIETEN";"Sir, all patrols are in. No contact from Skywalker or Solo yet."
"THREEEPIO"; "Ms. Leia, Artoo says he has been unable to pick up any signals, although he admits that his own range is too weak for to abandon all hope."
"DERLIN";"Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The armored doors must be closed."
"DERLIN";"Close the doors."
"LIETEN";"Yes, sir."
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo says the odds of survival are seven hundred and seventy-five... to one."
"THREEEPIO";"Actually, Artoo is known to make mistakes... from time to time. Oh dear, oh dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be fine. . He's quite smart, you know... for a human being."
"BEN";"Luke...Luke."
"LUKE";"Ben?"
"BEN";"You will go to the Dagobah system."
"LUKE";"Dagobah System?"
"BEN";"There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me."
"LUKE";"Ben...Ben."
"HAN";"Luke! Luke! Don't do that, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here."
"HAN";"Not long."
"LUKE";"Ben...Ben..."
"HAN";"Hold on, kid."
"LUKE";"Dagobah System..."
"HAN";"Whew..."
"LUKE";"Dagobah..."
"HAN";"That might stink, kid..."
"LUKE";"Yoda..."
"HAN";"...but it will keep you warm...until I build the shelter. Ooh...I thought they smelled bad outside!"
"ZEV";"Echo Base... I have something! Not much, but it could be a life form."
"ZEV";"This is Rouge Two. This is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two."
"HAN";"Good morning. Glad you came."
"ZEV";"Echo Base... this is Rouge Two. I found them. Again, I found them."
"THREEEPIO";"Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again."
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo expresses his relief too."
"HAN";"How are you feeling, boy? You don't look too bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to rip a Gundark's ears off."
"LUKE";"Thanks to you."
"HAN";"That's two you owe me, junior."
"HAN";"Well, Your Honor, looks like you managed to keep me around for a while longer."
"READ";"I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it is dangerous for any ship to leave the system until we have activated the energy shield."
"HAN";"That's a good story. I guess you just can't keep a handsome guy like me out of your sight."
"READ";"I don't know where you get your delusions from, laser brain."
"HAN";"Laugh at this, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage."
"HAN";"She expressed her true feelings for me."
"READ";"My...! Why, you stuck-up,...stupid,...scruffy looking...nerf-herder!"
"HAN";"Who's scruffy looking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to make her all pissed off like that, huh, kid?"
"READ";"Well, I guess you still don't know everything about women?"
"ANNOUNCER";"Headquarters personnel, report to the command center."
"HAN";"Calm down."
"THREEEPIO";"Excuse me, please."
"RIEEKAN";"Princess... we have a visitor."
"RIEEKAN";"We took something off base in zone twelve, moving east."
"SENIOR CONTROLLER";"It's metal."
"READ";"Then it can't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke."
"HAN";"It could be a speeder, one of ours."
"SENIOR CONTROLLER";"No. Wait - there's something very weak coming."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code."
"HAN";"It's not friendly, whatever. Come on, Chewie, let's have a look."
"RIEEKAN";"Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to season three and eight."
"HAN";"I'm afraid there's not much left."
"READ";"What happened?"
"HAN";"Droid of some kind. I didn't hit that hard. It must have self-destructed."
"READ";"An imperial probe droid."
"HAN";"It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here."
"RIEEKAN";"We'd better start the evacuation."
"PIETT";"Admiral."
"OZZEL";"Yes, Captain"
"PIETT";"I think we have something, sir. The report is only a fragment."
"OZZEL";"We have thousands of probe droids scouring the galaxy. I want proof, not clues!"
"PIETT";"Visuals indicate life readings."
"OZZEL";"It could mean anything. If we follow all the clues..."
"PIETT";"But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms."
"VADER";"Did you find anything?"
"PIETT";"Yes, my lord."
"VADER";"That's it. The rebels are there."
"OZZEL";"My lord, there are so many unknown settlements. They could be smugglers, they could be..."
"VADER";"That's the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men."
"REBEL CAPTAIN";"Groups seven and ten will stay behind to pilot the speeders. Once each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch."
"REBEL FIGHTER";"Right, sir."
"HAN";"Okay, that's it. Try it... Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off!"
"MED DROID";"Sir, it will take a while to evacuate the T-47s."
"LUKE";"Well, forget about the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules into the transports."
"MED DROID";"Careful, sir."
"LUKE";"Thanks."
"LUKE";"Chewie, take care, ok?"
"HAN";"Hi, kid. There must be a reason for this. Check the other end. Wait a sec. Are you okay?"
"LUKE";"Yes."
"HAN";"Be careful."
"LUKE";"You too."
"CONTROLLER";"General, there is a fleet of Star Destroyers leaving hyperspace in sector four."
"RIEEKAN";"Redirect all energy to the energy shield. We have to hold them until all transports move away. Prepare for the ground attack."
"VADER";"What is it, General?"
"VEERS";"My lord, the fleet has left the speed of light. The Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment."
"VADER";"The rebels have been alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel has left the speed of light very close to the system."
"VEERS";"He thought the surprise was wiser..."
"VADER";"He's as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack."
"VIAR";"Yes, my lord."
"OZZEL";"Lord Vader, the fleet has left the speed of light, and we are preparing to... Aaagh!"
"VADER";"You failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett."
"PIETT";"Yes, my lord."
"VADER";"Prepare to land troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing leaves this system. You are in charge now, Admiral Piett."
"PIETT";"Thank you, Lord Vader."
"READ";"All troop carriers will gather at the northern entrance. Heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they are loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports."
"HOBBIE";"Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?"
"READ";"The ion cannon will fire multiple shots to ensure any enemy ships are out of your flight path. When you pass the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?"
"PILOTS";"Right. Right."
"READ";"Good luck."
"DERLIN";"Okay. Everyone to your posts. Let's go!"
"RIEEKAN";"Your main target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield."
"CONTROLLER";"Sir, rebel ships are entering our sector."
"CAPTAIN";"Good. Our first capture of the day."
"WOMAN CONTROLLER";"Wait, ion control....Fire!"
"ANNOUNCER";"The first transport is far away."
"DACK";"Feeling good sir?"
"LUKE";"Like new, Dack. How about you?"
"DACK";"Right now I feel like I could face the entire Empire alone."
"LUKE";"I know what you mean."
"TRENCH OFFICER";"Echo Station Three-T-Eight."
"TRENCH OFFICER";"We've spotted imperial walkers!"
"CONTROLLER";"Imperial Walkers on the North Ridge."
"LUKE";"Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way."
"LUKE";"Alright guys, hold on tight now."
"DACK";"Luke, I don't have an approach vector. I'm not ready."
"LUKE";"Firm, Dack. Delta of the attack pattern. Go now!"
"LUKE";"Alright, I'm coming in."
"LUKE";"Hobbie, are you still with me?"
"LUKE";"This armor is too strong for blasters."
"LUKE";"Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow lines. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance to stop them. All right, wait, Dack."
"DACK";"Luke, we have a fire control malfunction. I'll have to cut the auxiliary."
"LUKE";"Hold on. Hold on, Dack. Get ready to shoot that towline."
"LUKE";"Dack? Dack!"
"VEERS";"Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will drop in moments. You can start landing."
"LUKE";"Rouge Three."
"WEDGE";"Copy, Rouge Leader"
"LUKE";"Wedge, I lost my gunner. You'll have to make that shot. I'll cover you. Place your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass."
"WEDGE";"Approaching, Leader Rouge."
"LUKE";"Firm, Rouge Two"
"WEDGE";"Enable harpoon."
"WEDGE";"Good shot, Janson."
"WEDGE";"One more pass."
"JANSON";"Approaching. Again."
"JANSON";"One more."
"JANSON";"I'm out! Let her go!"
"WEDGE";"Disconnect the cable."
"JANSON";"Cable disconnected."
"TRENCH OFFICER";"Let's go!"
"WEDGE";"Whooha!! That got him!"
"LUKE";"I see, Wedge. Good job."
"RIEEKAN";"I don't think we can protect two transports at the same time."
"READ";"It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice."
"RIEEKAN";"Launch patrols."
"READ";"Evacuate remaining ground personnel."
"HAN";"No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?"
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, got it? And... take care of yourself. Oh dear, oh dear."
"VEERS";"All troops will land for ground attack. Prepare to hit the main generator."
"LUKE";"Rouge Two, are you okay?"
"ZEV";"Yes. I'm with you, Leader Rouge."
"LUKE";"Let's put the harpoon in. I'll cover you."
"ZEV";"Coming this way."
"LUKE";"Watch out for the crossfire, guys."
"ZEV";"Set to position three. Stable."
"LUKE";"Stay steady and low."
"LUKE";"Hobbie, I got hit!"
"HAN";"Are you okay?"
"READ";"Why are you still here?"
"HAN";"I heard the command center was hit."
"READ";"You are allowed to leave."
"HAN";"Don't worry. I'm leaving. First I'll take you to your ship."
"THREEEPIO";"Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It is our only hope."
"READ";"Send all troops from sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters."
"ANNOUNCER";"Imperial troops have entered the base."
"HAN";"Come on...that's it."
"READ";"Give the evacuation code signal. And go to your transports!"
"MAIN CONTROLLER";"K-one-zero... all troops disengage."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh! Wait for me!"
"OFFICIAL";"Start the retreat!"
"SECOND OFFICER";"Back off!"
"VIAR";"Distance to power generators?"
"PILOT";"One-seven, decimal two-eight."
"VIAR";"Target. Maximum firepower."
"HAN";"Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I can't reach you. I'll take the princess out in the Falcon."
"THREEEPIO";"But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...go back!!"
"THREEEPIO";"Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!"
"THREEEPIO";"How typical."
"HAN";"Let's go."
"HAN";"Hurry up, Goldenrod, or you'll be a permanent resident!"
"THREEEPIO";"Wait! Wait!"
"HAN";"How is that?"
"READ";"Would it help if I went out and pushed?"
"HAN";"Can."
"THREEEPIO";"Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, may I suggest that you..."
"THREEEPIO";"You can wait."
"READ";"The bucket of bolts will never get us through this blockade."
"HAN";"This baby still has some surprises in it, honey."
"HAN";"Let's go! Let's go! Change. Let's hope we don't have a breakdown."
"HAN";"See?"
"READ";"Someday you will be wrong, and I hope to be there to see it."
"HAN";"Punch!"
"LUKE";"Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff."
"WEDGE";"Good luck, Luke. See you on the date."
"LUKE";"Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going."
"LUKE";"There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course."
"LUKE";"Let's not regroup with the others."
"LUKE";"We're heading to the Dagobah system."
"LUKE";"Yes, Artoo?"
"LUKE";"Alright. I'd like to keep it in manual control for a while."
"HAN";"I saw them! I saw them!"
"READ";"See what?"
"HAN";"Star Destroyers, two of them, heading straight for us."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, sir! May I suggest..."
"HAN";"Shut it up or turn it off! Check the deflector shield!"
"HAN";"Oh, great. Well, we can still beat them."
"IMPERIAL OFFICER";"Take evasive action!"
"HAN";"Get ready to jump to the speed of light."
"THREEEPIO";"But, sir!"
"READ";"They are approaching!"
"HAN";"Oh yeah? Check this out."
"READ";"Watch what?"
"HAN";"I think we're in trouble."
"THREEEPIO";"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator was damaged. It's impossible to go at the speed of light!"
"HAN";"We're in trouble!"
"HAN";"Horizontal reinforcements...!"
"HAN";"Alluvial dampers...! Well, that's not it."
"HAN";"Bring me the hydraulic wrenches!"
"HAN";"I don't know how we're going to get out of this."
"HAN";"Oww! Chewie!"
"HAN";"That wasn't a laser blast! Something hit us."
"READ";"Han, get up here!"
"HAN";"Come on, Chewie!"
"READ";"Asteroids!"
"HAN";"Oh no! Chewie, put two-seven-one."
"READ";"What are you doing? Aren't you really walking into an asteroid field?"
"HAN";"They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?"
"READ";"You don't have to do this to impress me."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, the probability of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one."
"HAN";"Never tell me the odds!"
"HAN";"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, that might be it, honey."
"READ";"I withdraw. We'll be pulverized if we stay here much longer."
"HAN";"I won't argue with that."
"THREEEPIO";"Sprayed?"
"HAN";"I'm going to approach one of the big ones."
"READ";"Closer?"
"THREEEPIO";"Closer?!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, that's suicide!"
"HAN";"Done. It looks really good."
"READ";"What looks really good?"
"HAN";"Yes. That will serve you well."
"THREEEPIO";"Excuse me ma'am, but where are we going?"
"READ";"I hope you know what you're doing."
"HAN";"Yes, me too."
"LUKE";"Yes, that's it. Dagobah."
"LUKE";"No, I won't change my mind about it. I'm not taking any cities or technology. Massive lifeform readings, though. There's something alive down there..."
"LUKE";"Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids."
"LUKE";"I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see anything! Just wait, I'll start the landing cycle..."
"LUKE";"No Artoo, stay there. I'll take a look."
"LUKE";"Artoo?"
"LUKE";"Artoo! Where are you?"
"LUKE";"Artoo! Be more careful."
"LUKE";"Artoo -- this way!"
"LUKE";"Artoo!"
"LUKE";"Oh no! Are you okay? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste too good. Anything broken?"
"LUKE";"If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm starting to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just freaking out."
"VADER";"Yes, Admiral?"
"PIETT";"Our ships have spotted the Millennium Falcon, sir. But... it has entered an asteroid field and we can't risk it..."
"VADER";"Asteroids don't worry me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses."
"PIETT";"Yes, sir."
"HAN";"I will shut down everything but the emergency power systems."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include turning me off too?"
"HAN";"No, I need you to talk to Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, it is quite possible that this asteroid is not fully stable."
"HAN";"Not fully stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor on your back and hook him up to the hyperdrive."
"THREEEPIO";"Ah! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm just trying to do my job in the most..."
"READ";"Let go."
"HAN";"Sshh!"
"READ";"Let go, please."
"HAN";"Don't get excited."
"READ";"Captain, being held by you is not enough to turn me on."
"HAN";"Sorry, honey. We don't have time for anything else."
"LUKE";"Ready for some energy? Okay. Let's see now. Put that there. Ready."
"LUKE";"Now all I have to do is find this Yoda... if he even exists."
"LUKE";"Still... there's something familiar about this place. I feel like... I don't know..."
"STRANGE VOICE"; "Feeling like what?"
"LUKE";"Like we're being watched!"
"CREATURE";"Away with your weapon! I don't want to harm you."
"CREATURE";"I'm wondering, why are you here?"
"LUKE";"I'm looking for someone."
"CREATURE";"Looking for? Found someone, do you have, I would say, hmmm?"
"LUKE";"Right."
"CREATURE";"I can help you. Yes, mmmm."
"LUKE";"I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior."
"CREATURE";"Ahhh! A great warrior. Wars don't make a great one."
"LUKE";"Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner."
"CREATURE";"How do you get so big, eating food like that?"
"LUKE";"Listen buddy, we didn't want to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out we would, but we can't, so why don't you..."
"CREATURE";"Oh, can't you get your ship out?"
"LUKE";"Hey, you could have broken that. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!"
"CREATURE";"Mine! Or I won't help you."
"LUKE";"I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'm going to need it to get out of this slimy quagmire."
"CREATURE";"Mudhole? Slimy? This is my house."
"CREATURE";"Ah, ah, ah!"
"LUKE";"Oh, Artoo, let him have it."
"CREATURE";"Mine! Mine!"
"LUKE";"Artoo!"
"CREATURE";"Mine!"
"CREATURE";"Mine!"
"LUKE";"Now are you going to move on, little friend? We have a lot of work to do."
"CREATURE";"No! No, no! Stay and help him, I will. Find your friend, hmm?"
"LUKE";"I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master."
"CREATURE";"Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda."
"LUKE";"Do you know him?"
"CREATURE";"Mmm. I take you to him, I will. Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come."
"CREATURE";"Come, come."
"LUKE";"Stay here and take care of the camp, Artoo."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?"
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says the energy coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it."
"HAN";"Well, of course I'll have to replace him."
"HAN";"Here! And Chewie..."
"HAN";"...I think it's better to replace the negative power coupling."
"HAN";"Hey, Your Honor, I'm just trying to help."
"READ";"Could you please stop calling me that?"
"HAN";"Sure, Leia."
"READ";"Oh, sometimes you make it so difficult."
"HAN";"I like it, I really like it. You could be a little nicer though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm fine."
"READ";"Occasionally maybe... when you're not acting like a scoundrel."
"HAN";"Scaundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that."
"READ";"Stop it."
"HAN";"Stop what?"
"READ";"Stop it! My hands are dirty."
"HAN";"My hands are dirty too. What are you afraid of?"
"READ";"Afraid?"
"HAN";"You're shaking."
"READ";"I'm not shaking."
"HAN";"You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life."
"READ";"I happen to like nice men."
"HAN";"I'm a good man."
"READ";"No, you are not. You are..."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, sir! I isolated the reverse power flow coupling."
"HAN";"Thank you. Thank you very much."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, you're welcome, sir."
"NEEDA";"...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our crosshairs. Considering the amount of damage we took, they must have been destroyed."
VADER";"No, Captain, they are alive. I want all available ships to scan the asteroid field until they are found."
"PIETT";"Lord Vader."
"VADER";"Yes, Admiral, what is it?"
"PIETT";"The Emperor orders you to make contact with him."
"VADER";"Move the ship out of the asteroid field so we can send a clear transmission."
"PIETT";"Yes, my lord."
"VADER";"What is your order, my master?"
"EMPEROR";"There is great disturbance in the Force."
"VADER";"I felt it."
"EMPEROR";"We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker."
"VADER";"Yes, my master."
"EMPEROR";"He could destroy us."
"VADER";"He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can't help him anymore."
"EMPEROR";"The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi."
"VADER";"If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally."
"EMPEROR";"Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?"
"VADER";"He will join us or die, my master."
"LUKE";"Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda right now."
"CREATURE";"Patience! For Jedi it's time to eat too. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?"
"LUKE";"How far is Yoda? How long will it take to get there?"
"CREATURE";"Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you'll be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why do you want you to become a Jedi? Hm?"
"LUKE";"Mainly because of my dad, I think."
"CREATURE";"Ah, your father. Mighty Jedi he was, mighty Jedi, mmm."
"LUKE";"Oh, come on. How can you meet my father? You don't even know who I am. Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. ."
"CREATURE";"I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience."
"BEN";"He will learn patience."
"YODA";"Hmmm. Lots of anger in him, like his father."
"BEN";"Was I different when you taught me?"
"YODA";"Hah. He's not ready."
"LUKE";"Yoda! I'm ready. I... Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready."
"YODA";"Ready, are you? What do you know? For eight hundred years I have trained Jedi. My own advice I will hold as to who should be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. long I watched. Didn't care where he was. Hmm? What was he doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi doesn't crave those things. You're reckless!"
"BEN";"Me too, if you remember."
"YODA";"He's too old. Yes, too old to start training."
"LUKE";"But I learned so much."
"YODA";"Will he finish what he started?"
"LUKE";"I won't fail you - I'm not afraid."
"YODA";"Oh, you will. You will."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, if I may have an opinion..."
"HAN";"I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio."
"READ";"There's something out there."
"HAN";"Where?"
"READ";"Outside, in the cave."
"THREEEPIO";"There it is. Listen! Listen!"
"HAN";"I'll go outside."
"READ";"Are you crazy?!"
"HAN";"I just got this bucket together. I won't let anything destroy it."
"READ";"Then I'll go with you."
"THREEEPIO";"I think it would be better if I stayed here and guarded the ship. Oh, no."
"READ";"This floor sure looks weird. It doesn't look like stone at all."
"HAN";"It's too damp here."
"READ";"I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this."
"HAN";"Yes."
"HAN";"Careful!"
"HAN";"Yes, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more trapped. They're chewing on the power cables."
"READ";"Mynocks?"
"HAN";"Go inside. We'll clean them up if there are any more."
"THREEEPIO";"Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Silly thing. Shoo! Shoo!"
"HAN";"Wait a minute..."
"HAN";"Alright Chewie, let's get out of here!"
"READ";"The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise..."
"HAN";"There is no time to discuss this as a committee."
"READ";"I am not a committee!"
"READ";"You can't jump to the speed of light in this asteroid field..."
"HAN";"Sit down, honey. We're taking off!"
"THREEEPIO";"Look!"
"HAN";"I see, I see."
"THREEEPIO";"We are doomed!"
"READ";"The cave is collapsing."
"HAN";"This is not a cave."
"READ";"What?"
"YODA";"Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression. The dark side of the Force is them. join you in a fight. If once you start the dark path, it will forever dominate your destiny, consume you, as it did with Obi-Wan's apprentice."
"LUKE";"Vader. Is the dark side stronger?"
"YODA";"No...no...no. Faster, easier, more seductive."
"LUKE";"But how am I going to tell the good from the bad?"
"YODA";"You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."
"LUKE";"But tell me why I can't..."
"YODA";"No, no, there's no point. I'm not going to teach you anything else today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm."
"LUKE";"Is there someone something wrong here."
"LUKE";"I feel cold, death."
"YODA";"That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. It is an evil domain. In you must go."
"LUKE";"What's in there?"
"YODA";"Only what you take with you."
"YODA";"Your weapons...you won't need them."
"PIETT";"Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum."
"FIRST CONTROLLER";"Yes sir."
"PIETT";"These rebels will not escape us."
"SECOND CONTROLLER";"Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger."
"PIETT";"Right."
"VADER"; "...there will be a substantial reward for whoever finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegration."
"BOBA FETT";"As you wish."
"PIETT";"Lord Vader! My lord, we have them."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, thank God we're getting out of the asteroid field."
"HAN";"Let's get out of here. Ready for the speed of light? One...two...three!"
"HAN";"It's not fair!"
"HAN";"Transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!"
"READ";"No speed of light?"
"HAN";"It's not my fault."
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit to the rear quarter and we're done."
"HAN";"Turn it over."
"HAN";"I said flip her over! I'll put all my power into the front shield."
"READ";"Are you going to attack them?!"
"THREEEPIO";"Sir, the odds of surviving a direct attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer..."
"READ";"Shut up!"
"NEEDA";"They are moving into attack position. Shields up!"
"NEEDA";"Track them. They may appear for another pass."
"TRACKING OFFICER";"Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears in our crosshairs."
"NEEDA";"They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device."
"TRACKING OFFICER";"Well, there's no trace of them, sir."
"COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER";"Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit."
"NEEDA";"Prepare a shuttle. I will take full responsibility for losing it, and I apologize to Lord Vader. In the meantime, continue to search the area."
"COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER";"Yes, Captain Needa."
"YODA";"Use the Force. Yes..."
"YODA";"Now... the stone. Feel it."
"YODA";"Concentrate!"
"LUKE";"Oh no. We will never release it now."
"YODA";"So right you are. Always with you it can't be done. Didn't you hear anything I said?"
"LUKE";"Master, moving stones is one thing. This is entirely different."
"YODA";"No! It's not different! Just different in your mind. You must unlearn what you've learned."
"LUKE";"Alright, I'll try."
"YODA";"No! Do not try. Do. Or do not. There is no attempt."
"LUKE";"I can't. It's too big."
"YODA";"Size doesn't matter. Look at me. Judge me by my size, won't you? Hm? Mmmm."
"YODA";"And well, you shouldn't. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and connects us. Luminous beings are us... .. .not this raw matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship !"
"LUKE";"You want the impossible."
"LUKE";"I don't...I don't believe it."
"YODA";"That's why you fail."
"VADER";"Apologies accepted, Captain Needa."
"PIETT";"Lord Vader, our ships have completed scanning the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon has entered the speed of light, it will already be on the other side of the galaxy."
"VADER";"Alert all commands. Calculate all possible destinations along your last known trajectory."
"PIETT";"Yes, my lord. We will find them."
"VADER";"Don't fail me again, Admiral."
"PIETT";"Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet."
"THREEEPIO";"Captain Solo, this time you've gone too far. No, I won't be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?"
"HAN";"The fleet is starting to disintegrate. Go back and wait for manual landing grapple release."
"THREEEPIO";"I really don't see how this will help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire might be kind enough..."
"HAN";"Thank you."
"READ";"What do you have in mind for your next move?"
"HAN";"Well, if they follow standard Empire procedure, they'll dump the garbage before going to light speed, so we just float away."
"READ";"With the rest of the garbage. And then?"
"HAN";"Then we have to find a safe haven somewhere around here. Do you have any ideas?"
"READ";"No. Where are we?"
"HAN";"The Anoat system."
"READ";"Anoat System. There's not much there."
"HAN";"No. Well wait. This is interesting. Lando."
"READ";"Lando System?"
"HAN";"Lando is not a system, he is a man. Lando Calrissian. He is a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You would like him."
"READ";"Thank you."
"HAN";"Bespin. It's too far, but I think we can do it."
"READ";"A mining colony?"
"HAN";"Yes, a Tibanna gas mine. Lanot deceived anyone. We've come a long way, Lando and I."
"READ";"Can you trust him?"
"HAN";"No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that."
"HAN";"Here we go, Chewie. Wait. Let go!"
"READ";"You have your moments. Not many, but you do."
"YODA";"Focus... feel the flow of the Force. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future... the past. Old friends are gone. "
"LUKE";"Han! Read!"
"YODA";"Hmm. Control, control. You must learn to control."
"LUKE";"I saw... I saw a city in the clouds."
"YODA";"Mmm. Friends you have there."
"LUKE";"They were in pain."
"YODA";"It's the future you see."
"LUKE";"Future? Will they die?"
"YODA";"Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future."
"LUKE";"I have to go to them."
"YODA";"Decide how you should best serve them. If you leave now, help them as you could. But you would destroy everything they fought and suffered for."
"HAN";"No, I don't have a landing clearance. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian."
"HAN";"Wow! Wait a minute! Let me explain."
"INTERCOM VOICE";"You will not deviate from your current course."
"THREEEPIO";"Pretty delicate, aren't they?"
"READ";"I thought you knew this person."
"HAN";"Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he forgot about that."
"INTERCOM VOICE";"Permission granted to land on Platform Three-Two-Seven."
"HAN";"Thank you."
"HAN";"There's nothing to worry about. We're back, Lando and I."
"READ";"Who's worried?"
"THREEEPIO";"Ah. No one to find us."
"READ";"I don't like it."
"HAN";"Well, what would you like?"
"THREEEPIO";"Well, they let us land."
"HAN";"Look, don't worry. Everything will be fine. Trust me."
"HAN";"See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, ok?"
"LANDO";"Why, you slimy, traitorous, useless crook! You have a lot of courage coming here after what you pulled."
"LANDO";"How are you, you old pirate? Good to see you! Never thought I'd meet you again. Where have you been?"
"THREEEPIO";"Well, he seems very friendly."
"READ";"Yes...very nice."
"LANDO";"What are you doing here?"
"HAN";"Ahh... repairs. I thought you could help me."
"LANDO";"What did you do with my ship?"
"HAN";"Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost it to me fairly."
"LANDO";"Hello. What do we have here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. And who can you be?"
"READ";"Read."
"LANDO";"Welcome, Leia."
"HAN";"Alright, alright, you old smoothie."
"THREEPIO";"Hello sir. I'm See-Threepio, Human-Cyborg Relations. My facility is in your..."
"THREEEPIO";"Well, really!"
"LANDO";"What's wrong with Falcon?"
"HAN";"Hyperdrive."
"LANDO";"I'll make my people work on it."
"HAN";"Good."
"LANDO";"You know, that ship saved my life a few times. It's the fastest piece of junk in the galaxy."
"HAN";"How is the gas mine? Is it worth it to you?"
"LANDO";"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of all kinds. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?"
"HAN";"You. Listen to you - you seem like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who would have thought that, huh?"
"LANDO";"You know, seeing you sure brings some things back."
"HAN";"Yes."
"LANDO";"Yes, I am responsible these days. It's the price you pay for success."
"THREEEPIO";"Ah! It's nice to see a familiar face."
"SECOND THREE EPIOS";"And chu ta!"
"THREEEPIO";"How rude!"
"THREEEPIO";"That sounds like an R2 unit over there. Could it be..."
"THREEEPIO";"Hello? How interesting. Oh, my."
"MAN";"Who are you?"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!"
"YODA";"Luke! You must complete the training."
"LUKE";"I can't get the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I have to help them."
"YODA";"You must not go!"
"LUKE";"But Han and Leia will die if I don't."
"BEN";"You don't know that."
"BEN";"Even Yoda can't see their fate."
"LUKE";"But I can help you! I feel the Force!"
"BEN";"But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force."
"YODA";"Yes, yes. For Obi-Wan you hear. The cave. Remember your failure in the cave!"
"LUKE";"But I've learned a lot since then. Master Yoda, I promise to come back and finish what I started. You have my word."
"BEN";"It's you and your skills that the Emperor wants. That's why your friends are made to suffer."
"LUKE";"And that's why I have to go."
"BEN";"Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader."
"LUKE";"You won't."
"YODA";"They must be standing still. That depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you finish your training now, if you choose the fast and Easy, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil."
"BEN";"Patience."
"LUKE";"And sacrifice Han and Leia?"
"YODA";"If you honor what they fight for...yes!"
"BEN";"If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere."
"LUKE";"I see. Artoo, turn on the converters."
"BEN";"Luke, don't give in to hate - it leads to the dark side."
"YODA";"Strong is Vader. Be careful what you learn. Save you may."
"LUKE";"I will. And I will come back. I promise."
"YODA";"I told you, I told you. He's reckless. Now things are worse."
"BEN";"This boy is our last hope."
"YODA";"No. There is another one."
"HAN";"The ship is almost ready. Two or three more things and we're in great shape."
"READ";"The sooner the better. Something is wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's gone too long to get lost."
"HAN";"Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out."
"READ";"I don't trust Lando."
"HAN";"Well, I don't trust him either. But he's my friend. Besides, we'll be leaving soon."
"READ";"And so you're gone, aren't you?"
"READ";"What happened?"
"HAN";"Where? Did you find it in a pile of garbage?"
"READ";"Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can fix it?"
"HAN";"Lando has people who can fix it."
"READ";"No, thanks."
"LANDO";"Sorry. Am I interrupting something?"
"READ";"Not really."
"LANDO";"You look absolutely beautiful. You really belong here with us among the clouds."
"READ";"Thank you."
"LANDO";"Can you join me for refreshment?"
"LANDO";"All are invited, of course."
"LANDO";"Having trouble with your droid?"
"HAN";"No. No problem. Why?"
"LANDO";"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall under the... uh... jurisdiction of the Empire."
"READ";"So you're part of the mining guild?"
"LANDO";"No, not really. Our operation is small enough to go unnoticed... which is to everyone's advantage as our customers are eager to avoid drawing attention to themselves."
"HAN";"Aren't you afraid the Empire will find out about this little operation and shut it down?"
"LANDO";"This has always been a danger hanging like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have evolved to ensure safety. I just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever."
"VADER";"We would be honored if you would join us."
"LANDO";"I had no choice. They arrived long before you. I'm sorry."
"HAN";"I'm sorry too."
"LUKE";"No, Threepio has them."
"LUKE";"Hold on. We're almost there."
"THREEEPIO";"Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take it off! I, uh, don't want to intrude here. I, no, no, no, no... Please don't get up . No!"
"THREEEPIO";"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!"
"LANDO";"Lord Vader."
"VADER";"You can take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker."
"BOBA FETT";"He's no good for me dead."
"VADER";"He will not take permanent damage."
"LANDO";"Lord Vader, and Leia and the Wookiee?"
"VADER";"They must never leave this city again."
"LANDO";"That was never a condition of our agreement, nor giving Han to that bounty hunter!"
"VADER";"Perhaps you think you are being treated unfairly."
"LANDO";"No."
"VADER";"Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here."
"LANDO";"This business is getting worse and worse."
"THREEEPIO";"Oh yeah, that's really good. I like it. Oh! Something's not right 'cause now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh my! what did you do? I'm behind you ball stupid hairstyling. Only a thickhead like you would be stupid enough..."
"HAN";"I feel terrible."
"READ";"Why are they doing this?"
"HAN";"They never asked me any questions."
"READ";"Lando."
"HAN";"Get out of here, Lando!"
"LANDO";"Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to hand Leia and Chewie over to me."
"HAN";"For you?"
"LANDO";"They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe."
"READ";"What about Han?"
"LANDO";"Vader is giving it to the bounty hunter."
"READ";"Vader wants us all dead."
"LANDO";"He doesn't want you at all. He's after someone named Skywalker."
"HAN";"Luke?"
"LANDO";"Lord Vader has set a trap for him."
"READ";"And we are the bait."
"LANDO";"Well, he's on his way."
"HAN";"Perfect. You fixed us all very well, didn't you? My friend!"
"LANDO";"Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I didn't do better, but I have my own problems."
"HAN";"Yes, you are a true hero."
"READ";"You certainly have a way with people."
"VADER";"This facility is rudimentary, but should be adequate to freeze Skywalker on his journey to the Emperor."
"IMPERIAL SOLDIER";"Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class."
"VADER";"Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land."
"LANDO";"Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing.kill him."
"VADER";"I don't want the Emperor's prize to be damaged. Let's test it... on Captain Solo."
"THREEEPIO";"If you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish."
"HAN";"What's going on... friend?"
"LANDO";"You are being put into carbon freeze."
"BOBA FETT";"What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me."
"VADER";"The Empire will compensate him if he dies. Put him here!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!"
"HAN";"Stop, Chewie, stop! Can you hear me? Stop!"
"THREEEPIO";"Yes, please stop! I'm not ready to die."
"HAN";"Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!"
"HAN";"Save your strength. There will be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. Did you hear me?"
"READ";"I love you!"
"HAN";"I know."
"THREEEPIO";"What... what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh... they've wrapped him in carbonite. He should be well protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. ."
"VADER";"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?"
"LANDO";"Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation."
"VADER";"He's all your bounty hunter. Reset the chamber to Skywalker."
"IMPERIAL OFFICER";"Skywalker has just landed, my lord."
"VADER";"Good. Have him find his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship."
"LANDO";"You said they would be left in the city under my supervision."
"VADER";"I am amending the agreement. Please do not amend further."
"READ";"Luke! Luke, no -- it's a trap! It's a trap!"
"VADER";"The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not yet a Jedi."
"LANDO";"Very well. Hold them in the security tower - and be quiet. Move."
"READ";"What do you think you're doing?"
"LANDO";"Let's get out of here."
"THREEEPIO";"I knew all along that it had to be a mistake."
"READ";"Do you think after what you did to Han we will trust you?"
"LANDO";"I had no choice..."
"THREEEPIO";"What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!"
"READ";"Ah, so we get it, don't we, Chewie? He didn't have a choice."
"LANDO";"I'm just trying to help..."
"READ";"We don't need your help."
"LANDO";"Haaa..."
"READ";"What?"
"THREEEPIO";"Looks like Han."
"LANDO";"There's still a chance to save Han... I mean, on the East Platform..."
"READ";"Chewie."
"THREEEPIO";"I'm sorry about all this. After all, he's just a Wookiee."
"BOBA FETT";"Put Solo Captain in the cargo hold."
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?"
"THREEEPIO";"Turn around, you furry...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!"
"THREEEPIO";"Well, at least you're still in one piece! Look what happened to me!"
"THREEEPIO";"Oh no! Chewie, they're after you!"
"VADER";"You learned a lot, young man."
"LUKE";"You'll find I'm full of surprises."
"VADER";"Your fate is with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true."
"LUKE";"No!"
"VADER";"Too easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought."
"VADER";"Impressive... more impressive."
"VADER";"Obi-Wan taught you well. You've mastered your fear... now release your anger."
"VADER";"Only your hate can destroy me."
"LANDO";"Security codes have been changed!"
"THREEEPIO";"Artoo, you can tell the computer to replace the security system."
"LANDO";"Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has taken control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive."
"LANDO";"This way."
"THREEEPIO";"Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I shouldn't be able to tell an outlet from a computer terminal."
"THREEEPIO";"What are you talking about? We're not interested in the Millennium Falcon hyperdrive. It's fixed! Just open the door, you idiot."
"THREEEPIO";"I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!"
"THREEEPIO";"Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Get down, you thoughtless... Ouch!"
"LANDO";"Read! Go!"
"THREEEPIO";"I thought that furry beast would be the end of me. Of course, I look better."
"VADER";"You're defeated. It's useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed like Obi-Wan did."
"VADER";"There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You still haven't realized your importance. You've only just begun to discover your power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy."
"LUKE";"I will never join you!"
"VADER";"If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father."
"LUKE";"He told me enough! He told me you killed him."
"VADER";"No. I'm your father."
"LUKE";"No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!"
"VADER";"Look for your feelings. You know it's true."
"LUKE";"No! No! No!"
"VADER";"Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He foresaw it. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way."
"LUKE";"Ben...Ben, please!"
"LUKE";"Ben. Leia!"
"LUKE";"Listen to me! Read!"
"READ";"Luke... We have to go back."
"LANDO";"What?"
"READ";"I know where Luke is."
"LANDO";"But what about those fighters?"
"READ";"Chewie, just do it."
"LANDO";"But what about Vader?"
"LANDO";"Alright, alright, alright."
"VADER";"Bring my space shuttle."
"LANDO";"Look, there's someone up there."
"READ";"It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll go under him. Lando, open the upper hatch."
"READ";"Okay. Calm down, Chewie."
"READ";"Lando?"
"LANDO";"Okay, let's go."
"LUKE";"Oh, Leia."
"LANDO";"All right, Chewie. Let's go."
"READ";"I'll be right back."
"READ";"Star Destroyer."
"LANDO";"All right, Chewie. Ready for the speed of light."
"READ";"If your people fixed the hyperdrive."
"READ";"All coordinates are set. It's now or never."
"LANDO";"Punch!"
"LANDO";"They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault!"
"PIETT";"They will be within range of our tractor beam in a moment, sir."
"VADER";"Did your men disable the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?"
"PIETT";"Yes, my lord."
"VADER";"Good. Prepare the boarding party and prepare your weapons to stun."
"PIETT";"Yes, my lord."
"THREEEPIO";"Noisy brute. Why don't we enter at the speed of light?"
"THREEEPIO";"Can't we? How do you know the hyperdrive is disabled?"
"THREEEPIO";"Did the city's main computer tell you? Artoo-Detoo, you know you shouldn't trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
"VADER";"Luke."
"LUKE";"Dad."
"VADER";"Son, come with me."
"LUKE";"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
"LANDO";"Chewie!"
"LUKE";"It's Vader."

"LUKE";"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
"PIETT";"Alert all commands. Ready for tractor beam."

"THREEEPIO";"Oh, you did it!"
"LANDO";"Luke, we're ready to take off."
"LUKE";"Good luck, Lando"
"LANDO";"When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you."
"LUKE";"I'll meet you at the meeting point on Tatooine."
"LANDO";"Princess, let's find Han. I promise."
"LUKE"; "Chewie, I'll be waiting for his signal."
"LUKE";"Take care, you two. May the Force be with you."
"LUKE";"Ouch!"
